<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="d1" />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">My dear little Friends</span>,</p>

<p>I have again to thank you for the many kind
and delightful letters which I have received from
all parts of the world, and I cannot tell you how
happy I am to find that I have succeeded so well
in pleasing you with my stories.</p>

<p>What am I to say to the little boy who wrote, and
begged “that, if the Wallypug came to stay with
me again, would I please invite him too?” or to
the other dear little fellow who came to me with
tears in his eyes, to tell me that some superior
grown-up person had informed him that “there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
never was a Wallypug, and it was all just a pack
of nonsense”; that “Girlie never went to Why
at all, and that in fact there was no such place in
existence”?</p>

<p>I can only regretfully admit that, sooner or later
as we grow up to be men and women, there are
bound to be many fond illusions which are one
by one ruthlessly dispelled, and that many of the
dreams and thoughts which, in our younger days,
we cherish most dearly, the hard, matter-of-fact
world will always persist in describing as “a pack
of nonsense.” However, for many of us fortunately,
this tiresome time has not yet arrived,
and for the present we will refuse to give up our
poor dear Wallypug&mdash;for whom I declare I have
as great an affection and regard, as the most
enthusiastic of my young readers.</p>

<p>You will see that in the following story I have
described my own experiences during a recent
visit to the remarkable land over which His Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
reigns as a “kind of king”, and I may tell
you that, amongst all of the extraordinary creatures
that I met there, there was not one who expressed
the slightest doubt as to the reality of
what was happening; while for my own part, I
should as soon think of doubting the existence
of the fairies themselves, as of the simple, kind-hearted,
little Wallypug.</p>

<p>There now! I hope that I have given quite a
clear and lucid explanation, and one which will
prevent you from being made unhappy by any
doubts which may arise in your mind as to the
possibility, or probability, of this story. Please
don’t forget to write to me again during the
coming year.</p>


<p class="pr6">Believing me to be as ever,</p>
<p class="pr4">Your affectionate Friend,</p>
<p class="pr2">G. E. FARROW.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">HOW I WENT TO WHY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some time
past I have been
the guest of his
Majesty the Wallypug
at his palace in the mysterious kingdom
of Why&mdash;a country so remarkable that
even now I am only just beginning to get
used to my strange surroundings and stranger
neighbors. Imagine, if you can, a place where
all of the animals not only talk, but take an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
active part in the government of the land, a place
where one is as likely as not to receive an invitation
to an evening party from an ostrich, or is
expected to escort an elderly rhinoceros in to
dinner; where it is quite an everyday occurrence
to be called upon by a hen with a brood of young
chickens just as you are sitting down to tea, and
be expected to take a lively interest in her account
of how the youngest chick passed through its
latest attack of the “pip.”</p>

<p>In such a country, the unexpected is always
happening, and I am continually being startled
in the streets at being addressed by some dangerous-looking
quadruped, or an impertinent bird,
for I must say that as a class the birds are the
most insolent of all the inhabitants of this strange
land. There is in particular one old crow, a most
objectionable personage, and a cockatoo who is
really the most violent and ill-natured bird that I
have ever been acquainted with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>She takes a very active interest in Parliamentary
affairs, and is a strong supporter of woman’s
wrongs.</p>

<p>“Every woman has her wrongs,” she declares,
“and if she hasn’t she ought to have.”</p>

<p>You will naturally wish to know how I reached
this strange country, and will, no doubt, be surprised
when I tell you how the journey was
accomplished.</p>

<p>One morning a few weeks since, I received a
letter from his Majesty the Wallypug asking me
to visit him at his palace at Why, in order to assist
him in establishing some of our social customs
and methods of government, which he had so
greatly admired during his visit to England, and
which he was desirous of imitating in his own
land. A little packet was enclosed in the letter,
bearing the words, “The shortest way to Why.
This side up with <i>anxiety</i>.” “Well,” I thought,
“I suppose they mean ‘This side up with <i>care</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>’”
and was proceeding very carefully to open the
packet when a gust of wind rushed in at the window,
and blowing open the paper wrapper, scattered
the contents&mdash;a little white powder&mdash;in all
directions. Some particles flew up into my eyes,
and caused them to smart so violently that I was
obliged to close them for some time till the pain
had gone, and when I opened them again, what
do you think? I was no longer in my study at
home, but out on a kind of heath in the brilliant
sunshine, and apparently miles from a house of
any kind. A finger-post stood a little way in
front of me, and I could see that three roads met
just here. Anxiously I hurried up to the post to
see where I was. One arm pointed, “To Nowhere.”
“And I certainly don’t want to go
there,” I thought; the other one was inscribed,
“To Somewhere,” which was decidedly a little
better, but the third one said, “To Everywhere
Else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-017.jpg" width="300" height="484"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc">“THAT’S NOT MUCH USE.”</p>
</div>

<p>“And, good gracious me,” I thought,
“that’s not much use, for I don’t know in the
least now which of the last two roads to take.”
I was puzzling my brain as to what was the best
thing to be done, when I happened to look down
the road leading to “Nowhere,” and saw a curious-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
little person running towards me. He
had an enormous head, and apparently his arms
and legs were attached to it, for I could see no
trace of a body. He was flourishing something
in his hand as he ran along, and as soon as he
came closer I discovered that it was his card which
he handed to me with a polite bow and an extensive
smile, as soon as he got near enough to do so.</p>

<div class="limit1">
<p class="pr8 p1">“<i>MR. NOBODY,</i><br /></p>
<p class="pr4"><i>No. 1 NONESUCH-STREET,</i><br /></p>
<p class="pr2"><i>NOWHERE,</i>”</p>
</div>

<p class="pn1">is what I read.</p>

<p>The little man was still smiling and bowing,
so I held out my hand and said:</p>

<p>“How do you do, sir? I am very pleased to
make your acquaintance. Perhaps you can be
good enough to tell me&mdash;”</p>

<p>The little man nodded violently.</p>

<p>“To tell me where I am,” I continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Nobody looked very wise, and after a few
moments’ thought smiled and nodded more violently
than ever, and simply pointed his finger
at me.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I cried, rather impatiently; “of
course I know that I’m here, but what I want to
know is, what place is this?”</p>

<p>The little fellow knitted his brows, and looked
very thoughtful, and finally staring at me sorrowfully,
he slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>“You don’t know?” I inquired.</p>

<p>He shook his head again.</p>

<p>“Dear me, this is very sad; the poor man is
evidently dumb,” I said, half aloud.</p>

<p>Mr. Nobody must have heard me, for he nodded
violently, then resuming his former smile, he
bowed again, and turning on his heels ran back
in the direction of Nowhere, stopping every now
and then to turn around and nod and smile and
wave his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a remarkable little person,” I was just
saying, when I heard a voice above my head calling
out:</p>

<p>“Man! man!”</p>

<p>I looked up and saw a large crow perched on
the finger-post. He had a newspaper in one
claw, and was gravely regarding me over the
tops of his spectacles.</p>

<p>“Well! what are you staring at?” he remarked
as soon as he caught my eye.</p>

<p>“Well, really,” I began.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever seen a crow before?” he
interrupted.</p>

<p>“Of course I have,” I answered rather angrily,
for my surprise at hearing him talk was fast
giving way to indignation at his insolent tone
and manner.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, what do you want to stand
there gaping at me in that absurd way for?”
said the bird. “What did he say to you?” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
continued, jerking his head in the direction in
which Mr. Nobody had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, what was it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said I.</p>

<p>“Why, stupid, you said Nobody and nothing,
didn’t you, and as two negatives make an affirmative
that means he must have said something.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I don’t quite understand,” I said.</p>

<p>“Ignorant ostrich!” remarked the crow contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Look here,” I cried, getting very indignant,
“I will not be spoken to like that by a mere
bird!”</p>

<p>“Oh, really! Who do you think you are,
pray, you ridiculous biped? Where’s your hat?”</p>

<p>I was too indignant to answer, and though I
should have liked to have asked the name of the
place I was at, I determined not to hold any further
conversation with the insolent bird, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
walked away in the direction of “Somewhere,”
pursued by the sound of mocking laughter from
the crow.</p>

</div>

<p>I had not gone far, however, before I perceived
a curious kind of carriage coming towards me.
It was a sort of rickshaw, and was drawn by a
kangaroo, who was jerking it along behind him.
A large ape sat inside, hugging a carpet bag, and
holding on to the dashboard with his toes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s pass him with withering contempt,” I
heard one of them say.</p>

<p>“All right,” was the reply. “Drive on.”</p>

<p>“I say, Man,” called out the Ape, as they
passed, “we’re not taking the slightest notice of
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t you? Well, I’m sure I don’t care,”
I replied rather crossly.</p>

<p>The Kangaroo stopped and stared at me in
amazement, and the Ape got out of the rickshaw
and came towards me, looking very indignant.</p>

<p>“Do you know who I am?” he asked, striking
an attitude.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” I replied, “and what’s more, I
don’t care.”</p>

<p>“But I’m a person of consequence,” he
gasped.</p>

<p>“You are only an ape or a monkey,” I said
firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! I can clearly see that you don’t know
me,” remarked the Ape pityingly. “I’m Oom
Hi.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” I said unconcernedly. “I am afraid
I’ve never heard of you.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of Oom Hi,” cried the Ape.
“Why, I am the inventor of Broncho.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” I asked. “Good gracious!
what ignorance,” said the Ape; “here, go and
fetch my bag,” he whispered to the Kangaroo,
who ran back to the rickshaw and returned with
the carpet bag.</p>

<p>“This,” continued Oom Hi, taking out a bottle,
“is the article; it is called ‘Broncho,’ and is excellent
for coughs, colds, and affections of the
throat; you will notice that each bottle bears a
label stating that the mixture is prepared according
to my own formula, and bears my signature;
none other is genuine without it. The Wallypug,
when he returned from England and heard that
I had invented it, declared that I must be a
literary genius.”</p>

<p>“A what!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“A literary genius,” repeated the Ape, smirking
complacently.</p>

<p>“Why, what on earth has cough mixture to
do with literature?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” admitted Oom Hi,
“but the Wallypug said that in England any one
who invented anything of that sort was supposed
to possess great literary talent.”</p>

<p>“The Wallypug!” I exclaimed, suddenly remembering.
“Am I anywhere near his Kingdom
of Why, then?”</p>

<p>“Of course you are; it’s only about a mile or
two down the road. Are you going there?” inquired
Oom Hi.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” I answered. “I’ve had an invitation
from his Majesty, and should rather like to
go there, as I’m so near.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“His Majesty; he&mdash;he&mdash;he, that’s good,”
laughed the Kangaroo. “Do you call the Wallypug
‘his Majesty’?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Of course,” I replied, “he is a king, isn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“A <i>kind</i> of king,” corrected Oom Hi. “You
don’t catch us calling him ‘your Majesty,’ I can
tell you though, one animal is as good as another
here, and if anything, a little better. If you are
going to Why, we may as well go back with you,
and give you a lift in the rickshaw.”</p>

<p>“You’re very kind,” I said, gratefully.</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all; jump in,” said Oom
Hi.</p>

<p>“Hold on a moment,” said the Kangaroo.
“It’s <i>his</i> turn to pull, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said the Ape, getting
into the vehicle; “put him in the shafts!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I expostulated.</p>

<p>“Your turn to pull the rickshaw, you know;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
we always take turns, and as I have been dragging
it for some time it’s your turn now.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not going to pull that thing with you
two animals in it. I never heard of such a thing,”
I declared.</p>

<p>“Who are you calling an animal?” demanded
the Kangaroo, sulkily. “You’re one yourself,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose I am,” I admitted. “But I’m
not going to draw that thing, all the same.”</p>

<p>“Oh, get in, get in; don’t make a fuss. I suppose
I shall have to take a turn myself,” said Oom
Hi, grasping the handles, and the Kangaroo and
myself having taken our seats we were soon traveling
down the road. The Kangaroo turned out
to be a very pleasant companion after all, and
when he found out that I came from England
told me all about his brother, who was a professional
boxer, and had been to London and made
his fortune as the Boxing Kangaroo. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
quite delighted when I told him that I had seen
notices of his performance in the papers. We
soon came in sight of a walled city, which Oom
Hi, turning around, informed me was Why. And
on reaching the gate he gave the rickshaw in
charge of an old turtle, who came waddling up,
and each of the animals taking one of my arms,
I was led in triumph through the city gates to
the Wallypug’s palace, several creatures, including
a motherly-looking goose and a little gosling,
taking a lively interest in my progress, while a
giraffe in a very high collar craned his neck
through a port-hole to try and get a glimpse of
us as we passed under the portcullis.</p>

</div>
<p class="cap14">WE soon reached the
Wallypug’s palace,
which stood in
a large park in the
center of the city
of Why. I had
been very interested
in noticing the curious architecture in the
streets as we passed along, but was scarcely prepared
to find the palace such a very remarkable
place. It was a long, low, rambling building,
built in a most singular style, with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sorts of curious towers and gables at every
point.</p>

<p>Oom Hi and the Kangaroo saw me as far as
the entrance, and then took their departure, saying
that they would see me again another day, and
I walked up the stone steps, to what I imagined
to be the principal door, alone. To my great
surprise, however, I found that, instead of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the way in, it was nothing more or less than a
huge jam-pot, with a very large label on it marked
“Strawberry Jam,” while above it were the
words, “When is a door not a door?” “When is a
door not a door?” I repeated, vaguely conscious
of having heard the question before.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc">“SOLD AGAIN! SERVE YOU RIGHT!”</p>
</div>

<p>“Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha,” laughed a mocking voice at the
bottom of the steps, and looking down I saw an
enormous Cockatoo with a Paisley shawl over her
shoulders and walking with the aid of a crutched
stick.</p>

<p>“Sold again, were you? Serve you right,” she
cried. “When is a door not a door? Pooh! fancy
not knowing that old chestnut. Why! when it’s
a jar, of course, stupid. Bah!”</p>

<p>“It’s a very absurd practical joke, that’s all that
I can say,” I remarked, crossly, walking down
the steps again. “Perhaps you can tell me
how I am going to get into this remarkable
place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Humph! Perhaps I can and perhaps I won’t,”
said the Cockatoo. “I dare say it’s a better place
than you came from, anyhow. You’re not the
first man that has come down here with his superior
airs and graces, grumbling and finding
fault with this, that, and the other; but we’ll
soon take the conceit out of you, I can tell you.
Where’s your hat?”</p>

<p>This was the second creature that had asked
me this question, and really they threw so much
scorn and contempt into the inquiry that one
would imagine that it was a most disgraceful
offense to be without a head covering.</p>

<p>I thought the most dignified thing to do under
the circumstances was to take no further notice
of the bird, and was quietly walking away when
the Cockatoo screamed out again, “Where’s
your hat? Where’s your hat? Where’s your
hat?” each time louder and louder, till the last
inquiry ended in a perfect shriek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be so ridiculous,” I cried. “I’ve left it
at home, if you must know.”</p>

<p>“Down with the hatters!” screamed the Cockatoo
irrelevantly, “Down with the Wallypug!
Down with men without hats! Down with everybody
and everything!” and the wretched bird
danced about like a demented fury.</p>

<p>At the sound of all this commotion a number
of windows in the upper stories of the palace were
thrown open, and curious heads were popped out
to see what was the matter. Among them and
immediately over my head, I noticed the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s you, is it, kicking up all this fuss?”
he remarked as soon as he recognized me.</p>

<p>“Well, really!” I replied, “I think you might
have the politeness to say ‘How do you do?’
considering that it is some months since we
met.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you indeed?” said the Doctor-in-Law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
contemptuously. “Well, supposing I don’t care
one way or another. Where’s your hat?”</p>

</div>

<p>Before I could answer the Cockatoo had
screamed out “Down with the Doctor-in-Law!”
and the irate little man had replied by
throwing a book at her head out of the palace
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>I was thoroughly disgusted at this behavior
and at the strange reception that I was receiving,
and had fully determined to try and find some
way of getting home again, when, happening to
turn round, I saw his Majesty the Wallypug himself
running across the lawn towards me, with
both hands stretched out in welcome, and his
kind little face beaming with good nature.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do? How d’ye do?” he cried.
“So pleased to see you. Didn’t expect you quite so
soon, though. Come along&mdash;this way.” And his
Majesty led me to another entrance, and through
a large square hall hung with tapestry and many
quaint pieces of old-fashioned armor, to a door
marked “His Majesty the Wallypug. Strictly
private.” I noticed, in passing, that the words,
“His Majesty” had been partly painted out, and
“What cheek!” written above them. Once inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the door, the Wallypug motioned me to a
chair, and said, in a mysterious whisper,</p>

<p>“I’m <i>so</i> glad you came before <i>she</i> returned;
there’s so much I want to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;Madame&mdash;er, my sister-in-law,” he replied,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Your sister-in-law!” I exclaimed. “Why,
I didn’t know you were married.”</p>

<p>“Neither am I,” said his Majesty, with a
puzzled frown. “That’s the awkward part about
it.”</p>

<p>“But how on earth can you possibly have a
sister-in-law, unless you have a wife or a married
brother?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve never quite been able to understand
<i>how</i> they make it out,” said the poor Wallypug,
sorrowfully; “but I believe it is something
mixed up with the Deceased Wife’s Sister’s Bill,
and the fact that my uncle, The Grand Mochar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of Gamboza, was married twice. Anyhow, when
I returned from London I found this lady, who
<i>says</i> that she is my sister-in-law, established here
in the palace; and&mdash;and&mdash;” his Majesty sank his
voice to a whisper, “she rules me with a rod of
iron.”</p>

<p>I had no time to make further inquiries, for
just then the door opened, and a majestic-looking
person sailed into the room, and after looking me
up and down with elevated eyebrows, pointed
her finger at me, and said, in a stern voice:</p>

<p>“And <i>who</i> is this person, pray?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this,” said his Majesty, smiling nervously,
and bringing me forward, “is the gentleman
who was so kind to us in London, you know.
Allow me to present him, Mr. Er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I hope you have not been picking up any undesirable
acquaintances, Wallypug,” interrupted
his Majesty’s Sister-in-Law severely. “I don’t
like the look of him at all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry, madame, that my appearance
doesn’t please you,” I interposed, feeling rather
nettled; “perhaps under the circumstances I had
better&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>“You had better do as you are bid and speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
when you are spoken to,” remarked the lady
grimly. “Where’s your hat?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t one,” I replied, rather abruptly, I
am afraid, but I was getting quite tired of this
continual cross-questioning; “and really I don’t
see that it’s of the slightest consequence,” I ventured
to add.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t you,” said his Majesty’s Sister-in-Law,
with a sarcastic smile. “Well, that’s one
of the <i>many</i> points upon which we shall disagree.
Now, look here, I may tell you at once that I
don’t approve of you in the least; still, as you
are here now you had better remain; but mind,
no putting on parts or giving yourself airs and
graces, or I shall have something to say to you.
Do you understand?” And with a severe glance
at me, the lady folded her arms and stalked out
of the room, leaving his Majesty and myself staring
blankly at one another.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">A TERRIBLE NIGHT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> reception at Why had been such a very
peculiar one that I had fully made up my mind
to return home at once, but his Majesty the
Wallypug begged me so earnestly to stay with
him, at any rate for a few days, that I determined,
out of friendship to him, to put up as best
I could with that extraordinary person the Sister-in-Law,
and the rest of the creatures, and remain,
in order to help him if possible to establish his
position at Why on a firmer basis.</p>

<p>So I took possession of a suite of rooms in the
west wing of the palace, near his Majesty’s private
apartments, and we spent a very pleasant
evening together in my sitting-room, playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
draughts till bedtime, when his Majesty left me
to myself, promising that he would show me
around the palace grounds the first thing in the
morning.</p>

<p>After he had gone, there being a bright wood
fire burning in my bedroom, I drew a high-backed
easy-chair up to the old-fashioned fireplace,
and made myself comfortable for a little
while before retiring for the night.</p>

<p>My bedroom was a large, old-fashioned apartment,
with a low ceiling and curiously carved
oak wainscoting, and I watched the firelight
flickering, and casting all sorts of odd shadows
in the dark corners, till I must have fallen asleep,
for I remember awaking with a start, at hearing
a crash in the corridor outside my bedroom door.
A muttered exclamation, and a Pelican, carrying
a bedroom candlestick marched in, and carefully
fastened the door behind him.</p>

<p>“Great clumsy things&mdash;I can’t think who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
have left them there,” he grumbled, sitting down
and rubbing one foot against the other, as though
in pain. And I suddenly came to the conclusion
that he must have stumbled over my boots,
which I had stood just outside the door, in order
that they might be cleaned for the morning.</p>

<p>The Pelican had not noticed me in my high-backed
chair, and, being rather curious to see
what he was up to, I kept perfectly still.</p>

<p>Going over to a clothes press, which stood in
one corner of the room, the bird drew forth a
long white night-gown and a nightcap; these he
proceeded solemnly to array himself in, and then,
getting up on a chair, he turned back the bedclothes
with his enormous beak, and was just
about to hop into bed, when I thought that it
was time for me to interfere.</p>

<p>“Here! I say, what are you up to?” I called
out in a stern voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="pr2 reduct"><i>Wallypugland.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;h-h! Ah&mdash;h-h! There’s a man in my
room!” screamed the Pelican, evidently greatly
alarmed. “Murder! Fire! Police! Thieves!”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” I commanded. “What
do you mean by making all that noise at this
time of night, and what are you doing in my
room?”</p>

<p>“Your room, indeed!” gasped the bird; “my
room you mean, you featherless biped, you!”</p>

<p>“Look here!” I remarked, going up to the
Pelican, and shaking him till his beak rattled
again. “Don’t you talk to me like that, my
good bird, for I won’t put up with it.” You see
I was getting tired of being treated so contemptuously
by all of these creatures, and was determined
to put a stop to it, somehow.</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i> my room. Let me go, I say!”
screamed the bird, struggling to get free,
and dabbing at me viciously with his great
beak.</p>

<p>“It is not your room,” I maintained; “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
what is more, you are not going to stay here,”
and I pushed the creature towards the door.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon see all about that,” shouted the
Pelican, wrenching himself from my grasp, and
rushing at me with his beak wide open, and his
wings outstretched.</p>

<p>He was an enormous bird, and I had a great
struggle with him. We went banging about the
room, knocking over the furniture and making a
terrible racket. At last, however, I managed to
get him near the door, and giving a terrific shove
I pushed him outside, and, pulling the door to,
quickly turned the key.</p>

<p>I could hear Mr. Pelican slipping and stumbling
about on the highly polished floor of the
corridor outside, and muttering indignantly.
Presently he came to the door, and banging with
his beak, he cried, “Look here! this is beyond a
joke&mdash;let me in, I say&mdash;where do you suppose I
am going to sleep?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anywhere you like except here,” I replied,
feeling that I had got the best of it. “Go and
perch or roost, or whatever you call it, on the
banisters, or sleep on the mat if you like&mdash;I don’t
care what you do!”</p>

<p>“Impertinent wretch!” yelled the bird.
“You only wait till the morning. I’ll pay you
out;” and I could hear him muttering and
mumbling in an angry way as he waddled down
the corridor to seek some other resting-place.
“What ridiculous nonsense it is,” I thought, as
I tumbled into bed shortly after this little episode;
“these creatures giving themselves such airs.
No wonder the Wallypug is such a meek little
person if he has been subjected to this sort of
treatment all his life.” And pondering over the
best method of altering the extraordinary state
of affairs, I dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>I do not know how long it may have been after
this, but a terrific din, this time in the courtyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>

below my window, caused me once more to jump
from my bed in alarm. I could hear a most unearthly
yelling going on, a babel of voices, and
occasionally a resounding crash as though something

</div>

<p>Pushing open the latticed windows I saw in the
moonlight a little man dressed in a complete suit
of armor with an enormous shield, like a dishcover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
arranged over his head, playing the guitar,
and endeavoring to sing to its accompaniment.
He was continually interrupted, however, by a
shower of missiles thrown from all of the windows
overlooking the courtyard, out of which angry
heads of animals and other occupants of the palace
were thrust; he was surrounded by a miscellaneous
collection of articles which had evidently been
thrown at him, and some of them, had it not been
for his suit of armor and the erection over his
head, would have caused him considerable injury.</p>

<p>He did not seem to mind them in the least,
though, and continued singing amid a perfect
storm of boots, brushes, and bottles, as though
he was quite accustomed to such treatment: and
it was only when an irate figure, which somehow
reminded me of his Majesty’s Sister-in-Law, clad
in white garments and flourishing a pair of tongs,
appeared in the courtyard, that he took to his
heels and fled, pursued by the white-robed apparition,
till both disappeared beneath an archway
at the farther end of the courtyard. Most
of the windows were thereupon closed, and the
disturbed occupants of the palace returned to their
rest. I was just about to close my lattice too,
when I caught sight of a familiar figure at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
adjoining window. It was my old friend A. Fish,
Esq.</p>

<p>“Oh! id’s you iz id,” he cried. “You <i>have</i>
cub thed, I heard that you were egspegded.”</p>

<p>“Yes, here I am,” I replied. “How are you?
How is your cold?”</p>

<p>“Oh, id’s quide cured, thags; dote you dotice
how butch better I speak?”</p>

<p>“I’m very glad to hear it, I’m sure,” I replied,
waiving the question and trying to keep solemn.
“What’s all this row about?”</p>

<p>“Oh! thad’s the troubadour, up to his old
gabes agaid; he’s ad awful dusadce. I’ll tell you
aboud hib in the bordig&mdash;good dight.” And A.
Fish, Esq., disappeared from view.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">LATE FOR BREAKFAST.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I awoke</span> very early in the morning, just as it
was daylight, and being unable to get to sleep
again amid my strange surroundings, I arose and
crept down-stairs as noiselessly as possible, intending
to go for a long walk before breakfast.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the stairs I came upon a
strange-looking white object, which, upon closer
inspection, turned out to be the Pelican, asleep
on the floor.</p>

<p>He was not sleeping as any respectable bird
would have done, with his head tucked under his
wing; but was lying stretched out on a rug in
the hall, with his head resting on a cushion. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
enormous beak was wide open, and he was snoring
violently, and muttering uneasily in his sleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc reduct">THE PELICAN WAS SNORING VIOLENTLY.</p>
</div>

<p>I did not disturb him for fear lest he should
make a noise; but hurrying past him I made my
way to the hall door, which after a little difficulty
I succeeded in unfastening. An ancient-looking
turtle with a white apron was busily cleaning
the steps, and started violently as I made my
appearance at the door.</p>

<p>“Bless my shell and fins!” he muttered;
“what’s the creature wandering about this time
of the morning for; they’ll be getting up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
middle of the night next. Just mind where
you’re treading, please!” he called out. “The
steps have been cleaned, and I don’t want to have
to do them all over again.”</p>

<p>I managed to get down without doing much
damage, and then remarked pleasantly:</p>

<p>“Good morning; have you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” interrupted the Turtle snappishly;
“and what’s more, I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I inquired, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Soap!” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“You’re an advertisement for somebody’s soap,
aren’t you?” asked the Turtle.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” I replied, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Your first remark sounded very much like
it,” said the Turtle suspiciously. “‘Good morning,
have you used&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to say that at all,” I interrupted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
“I was merely going to ask if you could
oblige me with a light.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s another thing entirely,” said the
Turtle, handing me some matches from his waistcoat
pocket, and accepting a cigarette in return.
“But really we have got so sick of those advertisement
catchwords since the Doctor-in-Law returned
from London with agencies for all sorts
of things, that we hate the very sound of them.
We are continually being told to ‘Call a spade a
spade,’ which will be ‘grateful and comforting’
to ‘an ox in a teacup’ who is ‘worth a guinea a
box,’ and who ‘won’t be happy till he gets it.’”</p>

<p>“It must be very trying,” I murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is,” remarked the Turtle. “Well,”
he continued in a business-like tone, “I’m sorry
you can’t stop&mdash;good morning.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything about going,” I ejaculated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t you? Well, I did then,” said the
Turtle emphatically. “Move on, please!”</p>

<p>“You’re very rude,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Think so?” said the Turtle pleasantly.
“That’s all right then&mdash;good-by,” and he flopped
down on his knees and resumed his scrubbing.</p>

</div>

<p>There was nothing for me to do but to walk on,
and seeing a quaint-looking old rose garden in
the distance, I decided to go over and explore.</p>

<p>I was walking slowly along the path leading to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it, when I heard a curious clattering noise behind
me, and turning around I beheld the Troubadour,
still in his armor, dragging a large
standard rosebush along the ground.</p>

<p>“As if it were not enough,” he grumbled, “to
be maltreated as I am every night, without having
all this trouble every morning. I declare it
is enough to make you throw stones at your
grandfather.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” I ventured to ask of
the little man.</p>

<p>“Matter?” was the reply. “Why, these
wretched rosebushes, they <i>will</i> get out their
beds at night, and wander about. I happened to
leave the gate open last night, and this one got
out, and goodness knows where he would have
been by this time if I hadn’t caught him meandering
about near the Palace.”</p>

<p>“Why! I’ve never heard of such a thing as a
rosebush walking about,” I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

     <p class="pc reduct">“IN YOU GO!”</p>
</div>

<p>“Never heard of a&mdash;&mdash;. Absurd!” declared
the Troubadour, incredulously. “Of course they
do. That’s what you have hedges and fences
around the gardens for, isn’t it? Why, you can’t
have been in a garden at night-time,
or you wouldn’t talk such
nonsense. All the plants are allowed
to leave their beds at midnight.
They are expected to be
back again by daylight, though,
and not go wandering about
goodness knows where like this beauty,” and he
shook the rosebush violently.</p>

<p>“In you go,” he continued, digging a hole with
the point of his mailed foot, and sticking the rosebush
into it.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he exclaimed, going up to another
one, at the foot of which were some broken twigs
and crumpled leaves. “You’ve been fighting, have
you? I say, it’s really too bad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what does it matter to you?” I inquired.
“It’s very sad, no doubt, but I don’t see why you
should upset yourself so greatly about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” was the reply, “I’m the head
gardener here as well as Troubadour, and so am
responsible for all these things. I do troubing
as an extra,” he explained. “Three shillings
a week and my armor. Little enough, isn’t it,
considering the risk?”</p>

<p>“Well, the office certainly does not seem overpopular,
judging from last night,” I laughed.
“Who were you serenading?”</p>

<p>“Oh, any one,” was the reply. “I give it
to them in turns. If any one offends me in the
daytime I pay them out at night, see?</p>

<p>“I serenaded the Sister-in-Law mostly, but I
shall give that up. She doesn’t play fair. I don’t
mind people shying things at me in the least, for
you see I’m pretty well protected; but when it
comes to chivying me round the garden with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
pair of tongs, it’s more than I bargained for.
Look out! Here comes the Wallypug,” he continued.</p>

<p>Sure enough his Majesty was walking down
the path, attended by A. Fish, Esq., who was
wearing a cap and gown and carrying a huge
book.</p>

<p>“Ah! good morning&mdash;good morning,” cried
his Majesty, hurrying towards me. “I’d no idea
you were out and about so early. I’m just having
my usual morning lesson.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said A. Fish, Esq., smiling, and offering
me a fin. “Ever sidse I god rid of by cold
I’ve been teaching the Wallypug elocutiod. We
have ad ‘our every bordig before breakfast, ad
he’s geddig on spledidly.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure his Majesty is to be congratulated
on having so admirable an instructor,” I remarked,
politely, if not very truthfully.</p>

<p>“Thags,” said A. Fish, Esq., looking very

<p>“Yes, go on, Wallypug!” chimed in the Troubadour,
indulgently.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said his Majesty, simpering
nervously. “I’m afraid I should break down.”</p>

<p>“Doe you wondt, doe you wondt,” said A.
Fish, Esq. “Cub alog, try id.”</p>

<p>So his Majesty stood up, with his hands folded
in front of him, and was just about to begin, when
a bell in a cupola on the top of the palace began
to ring violently.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, the breakfast bell! We shall
be late,” cried the Wallypug, anxiously grasping
my hand and beginning to run towards the
palace.</p>

<p>A. Fish, Esq., also shuffled along behind us as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
quickly as possible, taking three or four wriggling
steps, and then giving a funny little hop with his
tail, till, puffing and out of breath, we arrived
at the palace just as the bell stopped ringing.</p>

<p>His Majesty hastily rearranged his disordered
crown, and led the way into the dining hall.</p>

<p>A turtle carrying a large dish just inside the
door whispered warningly to the Wallypug as we
entered, “Look out! You’re going to catch it,”
and hurried away.</p>

<p>A good many creatures were seated at the table
which ran down the center of the room, and at
the head of which his Majesty’s Sister-in-Law
presided, with a steaming urn before her. The
Doctor-in-Law occupied a seat near by, and I
heard him remark:</p>

<p>“They are two minutes late, madame. I
hope you are not going to overlook it,” to
which the lady replied, grimly, “You leave
that to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sit there,” she remarked coldly, motioning
me to a vacant seat, and the Wallypug and A.
Fish, Esq., subsided into the two other unoccupied
chairs on the other side of the table.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE TRIAL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment nobody spoke. The Wallypug
sat back in a huddled heap in his chair, looking
up into Madame’s face with a scared expression.
A. Fish unconcernedly began to eat some steaming
porridge from a plate in front of him&mdash;and
I sat still and waited events.</p>

<p>A band of musicians in the gallery at the end
of the hall were playing somewhat discordantly,
till Madame turned around and called out in an
angry voice:</p>

<p>“Just stop that noise, will you? I can’t hear
myself speak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc reduct">“STOP THAT NOISE!”</p>
</div>

<p>The musicians immediately left off playing
with the exception of an old hippopotamus, playing
a brass instrument, who being deaf, and very
near-sighted, had neither heard what had been
said nor observed that the others had stopped.
With his eyes fixed on the music stand in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of him, he kept up a long discordant tootling on
his own account, gravely beating time with his
head and one foot.</p>

<p>His Majesty’s Sister-in-Law turned around furiously
once or twice, and then seeing that the
creature did not leave off, she threw a teacup at
his head, and followed it up with the sugar
basin.</p>

<p>The latter hit him, and hastily dropping his
instrument, he looked over the top of his spectacles
in surprise.</p>

<p>Perceiving that the others had left off playing,
he apparently realized what had happened, and
meekly murmuring, “I beg your pardon,” he
leaned forward with one foot up to his ear, to
hear what was going on.</p>

<p>“I’m waiting to know what you have to say
for yourselves,” resumed Madame, addressing
the Wallypug and myself.</p>

<p>“The traid was late, add there was a fog od<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the lide,” explained A. Fish, Esq., mendaciously,
with his mouth full of hot porridge.</p>

<p>“A likely story!” said the good lady sarcastically.
“A very convenient excuse, I must say;
but that train’s been late too many times recently
to suit me. I don’t believe a word of
what you are saying.”</p>

<p>“If I might venture a suggestion,” said the
Doctor-in-Law, sweetly, “I would advise that
they should all be mulcted in heavy fines, and I
will willingly undertake the collection of the
money for a trifling consideration.”</p>

<p>“It’s too serious a matter for a fine,” said the
Madame severely. “What do you mean by it?”
she demanded, glaring at me furiously.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure we are all very sorry,” I remarked,
“but I really do not see that being two
minutes late for breakfast is such a dreadful
affair after all.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you don’t, don’t you?” said the Sister-in-Law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
working herself up into a terrible state
of excitement; “Well, I do, then. Do you suppose
that you are going to do just as you please
here? Do you think that I am going to allow
myself to be brow-beaten and imposed upon by a
mere man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who hasn’t a hat to his back,” interposed the
Doctor-in-Law, spitefully.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue,” said the Sister-in-Law.
“I’m dealing with him now. Do you suppose,”
she went on, “that I am to be openly defied by a
ridiculous Wallypug and a person with a cold in
his head?”</p>

<p>“I’b sure I havn’d,” declared A. Fish, Esq.,
indignantly. “By code’s beed cured this last
bunth or bore.”</p>

<p>“Humph, sounds like it, doesn’t it?” said the
lady, tauntingly. “However, we’ll soon settle
this matter. We’ll have a public meeting, and
see who’s to be master, you or I.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hooray, public meeting! Public meeting!”
shouted all the creatures excitedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and at once,” said the Sister-in-Law
impressively, getting up and leaving the table,
regardless of the fact that scarcely anybody had
as yet had any breakfast.</p>

<p>The rest of the creatures followed her out of
the room.</p>

<p>When they had quite disappeared and the
Wallypug, A. Fish, Esq., and myself were left
alone, I thought that we might as well help ourselves
to some breakfast. So I poured out some
of the coffee, which we found excellent, and
had just succeeded in persuading his Majesty
to try a little bread and butter, when some
crocodiles appeared at the door and announced:
“You are commanded to attend the trial at
once.”</p>

<p>“What trial?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Your own,” was the reply. “You and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Wallypug are to be tried for ‘Contempt of Sister-in-Law,’
and A. Fish, Esq., is subpœnaed as a
witness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” said the poor Wallypug,
wringing his hands. “I know what that
means. Whatever shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Dever bide, old chap. I do the best I
cad to get you off,” said A. Fish, Esq. “Cub
alog, it will odly bake badders worse to delay.”</p>

<p>So we allowed ourselves to be taken in charge
by the crocodiles, and led to the Public Hall,
his Majesty and myself being loaded with
chains.</p>

<p>We found the Sister-in-Law and the Doctor-in-Law
seated at the judges’ bench when we entered.
The Sister-in-Law wore a judge’s red robe, and a
long, flowing wig under her usual head-dress,
and the Doctor-in-Law was provided with a slate,
pencil, and sponge.</p>

SCREAMED THE OSTRICH.</p>
</div>

<p>We were conducted to a kind of dock on one
side of the bench, and on the other side appeared
what afterwards transpired
to be the witness box. The
body of the hall was crowded
with animals, craning their
necks to catch a glimpse of us.</p>

<p>“Silence in court,” screamed
out a gaily-dressed ostrich,
and the trial began.</p>

<p>“We’ll take the man creature
first,” said the Sister-in-Law,
regarding me contemptuously. “Now
then, speak up! What have you got to say for
yourself?”</p>

<p>“There appears to be&mdash;” I began.</p>

<p>“Silence in court,” shouted the ostrich, who
was evidently an official.</p>

<p>“Surely I may be allowed to explain,” I protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Silence in court,” shouted the bird again.</p>

<p>I gave it up and remained silent. “Call the
first witness,” remarked the Sister-in-Law impatiently,
and the Turtle, whom I had seen cleaning
the steps in the morning, walked briskly up
into the witness-box.</p>

<p>“Well, Turtle, what do you know about this
man?” was the first question.</p>

<p>“So please your Importance, I was cleaning
my steps very early this morning, when the prisoner
opened the door in a stealthy manner and
crept out very quietly. ‘Ho!’ thinks I, ‘this
’ere man’s up to no good,’ and so I keeps him in
conversation a little while, but his language&mdash;oh!&mdash;and
what with one thing and another and
noticing that he hadn’t a hat, I told him he had
better move on. I saw him walk over to the rose
garden and afterwards join the Wallypug and
Mr. Fish. I think that’s all, except&mdash;ahem&mdash;that
I missed a small piece of soap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Soap?” said the Doctor-in-Law, elevating
his eyebrows. “This is important&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;what
kind of soap?”</p>

<p>“Yellow,” said the Turtle. “Fourpence a
pound.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said the Doctor-in-Law, “very mysterious,
but not at all surprising from what I
know of this person&mdash;call the next witness.”</p>

<p>The next witness was the Cockatoo, who
scrambled into the box in a great fluster.</p>

<p>“He’s a story-teller, and a pickpocket, and a
backbiter, and a fibber, and a bottle-washer,” she
screamed excitedly, “and a heartless deceiver,
and an organ-grinder, so there!” And she
danced out of the witness-box again excitedly,
muttering, “Down with him, down with him,
the wretch,” all the way back to her seat.</p>

<p>“Ah, that will about settle him, I fancy,” remarked
the Doctor-in-Law, putting down some
figures on his slate and counting them up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you doing?” demanded the Sister-in-Law.</p>

<p>“Summing up,” was the reply. “The judges
always sum up in England, you know; that’s
thirty-two pounds he owes. Shall I collect
it?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute till I pass the sentence,” said
the Sister-in-Law.</p>

<p>“Prisoner at the bar,” she continued, “you
have since your arrival here been given every
latitude.”</p>

<p>“And longitude,” interrupted the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

You have heard the evidence against you, and I
may say more clear proof could not have been
given. It appears that you are a thoroughly

<p>Then pointing to me tragically, she called out,
“Officers! take away that Bauble!” And I was
immediately seized by two of the crocodiles, preparatory
to being taken below.</p>

<p class="pch">HIS MAJESTY IS DEPOSED.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Stop</span> a minute!” cried Madame, as I was
being led away. “We may as well settle the
Wallypug’s affair at the same time and get rid of
them both at once. Put the creature into the
dock.”</p>

<p>His Majesty was hustled forward, looking very
nervous and white, as he stood trembling at the
bar, while Madame regarded him fiercely.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Ye-e-s!” stammered his Majesty, though
what the poor little fellow had to be ashamed of
was more than I could tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should think so, indeed,” commented the
lady. “Now then, call the first witness.”</p>

<p>The first witness was A. Fish, Esq., who
coughed importantly as he stepped up into the
box with a jaunty air. “Let’s see, what’s your
name?” asked the Doctor-in-Law, with a supercilious
stare. Now, this was absurd, for, of
course, he knew as well as I did what the Fish’s
name was; but as I heard him whisper to
Madame, the judges in England always pretend
not to know <i>anything</i>, and he was doing the same.</p>

<p>“By dabe is A. Fish, you doe thadt well
edough,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Don’t be impertinent, or I shall commit you
for contempt,” said the Doctor-in-Law, severely.
“Now then&mdash;ah&mdash;you are a reptile of some sort,
I believe, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Certainly dot!” was indignant reply.</p>

<p>“Oh! I thought you were. Er&mdash;what do you
do for a living?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’b a teacher of elocutiod add a lecturer,”
said A. Fish, Esq., importantly.</p>

<p>“Oh! indeed. Teacher of elocution, are you?
And how many pupils have you, pray?”</p>

<p>“Well, ad presend I’ve odly wud,” replied A.
Fish, Esq., “and that the Wallypug.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the Wallypug’s a pupil of yours, is he?
I suppose you find him very stupid, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Doe, I don’t!” said A. Fish, Esq., loyally.
“He’s a very clever pupil, ad he’s gettig od splendidly
with his recitig.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is he, indeed; and what do you teach
him, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“I’ve taught hib ‘Twinkle, twinkle, little star,’
ad ‘Billy’s dead ad gone to glory,’ ad several other
things frob Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>“Shakespeare? hum&mdash;ha&mdash;Shakespeare? I
seem to have heard the name before. Who is he?”</p>

<p>“A great poet, born in England in 1564, m’lud,”
explained one of the Crocodiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Really! He must be getting quite an old
man by now,” said the Doctor-in-Law, vaguely.</p>

<p>“He’s dead,” said A. Fish, Esq., solemnly.</p>

<p>“Dear me! poor fellow! what did he die of?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask such a lot of silly questions,” interrupted
the Sister-in-Law, impatiently; “get on
with the business. What has A. Fish to say on
behalf of the Wallypug? that is the question.”</p>

<p>“He’s gettig od very dicely with his recitig,”
insisted A. Fish, Esq. “He was repeatig a speech
from Richard III. to us this bordig whed the
breakfast bell rang, ad that’s why we were late
at table.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s the reason, is it?” said the Sister-in-Law.
“Bah! I’ve no patience with a man at
his time of life repeating poetry. Positively
childish, I call it. What was the rubbish?” she
demanded, turning to the Wallypug.</p>

<p>“A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse,”
began his Majesty, feebly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” shrieked the Sister-in-Law, starting
up from her seat. “Say that again!”</p>

<p>“‘A-a horse, a horse, my-my kingdom for a
horse,’” stammered the Wallypug, nervously.</p>

<p>“Traitor! Monster!” cried the Sister-in-Law
furiously. “Hear him!” she screamed. “He
actually has the effrontery to tell us to our faces
that he is willing to sell the whole of this kingdom
for a horse. Oh! it is too much! the heartless
creature! Oh-h!” and the lady sank back and
gasped hysterically. At this there was a terrible
uproar in the court&mdash;the animals stood up on the
seats, frantically gesticulating and crying:
“Traitor!” “Down with the Wallypug!” “Off
with his head!” “Banish him!” “Send him to
jail!” while above all could be heard the Cockatoo
screaming:</p>

<p>“I told you so. I told you so! Down with
the Wallypug! Off with his crown! Dance on
his sceptre, and kick his orb round the town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The poor Wallypug threw himself on his knees
and called out imploringly, “It’s all a mistake,”
and I tried in vain to make myself heard above
the uproar.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc reduct">“TRAITOR! MONSTER!” “OFF WITH HIS HEAD!”</p>
</div>

<p>The whole assembly seemed to have taken leave
of their senses, and for a few moments the utmost
confusion prevailed. The creatures nearest to the
Wallypug seemed as though they would tear him
to pieces in their fury, and if it had not been for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
his jailers, the Crocodiles, I am convinced they
would have done him some injury. “This is
outrageous,” I managed to shout at last. “You
are making all this disturbance for nothing.
What the Wallypug said was merely a quotation
from one of Shakespeare’s plays.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all very well to try and blame it on
to poor Shakespeare, when you know very well
he’s dead and can’t defend himself,” was Madame’s
reply. “That’s your artfulness. I’ve no doubt
you are quite as bad as the Wallypug himself,
and probably put him up to it.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Down with him! Down with the hatless
traitor!” screamed the Cockatoo.</p>

<p>And despite our protests the Wallypug and
myself were loaded with chains and marched off
by the Crocodiles, his Majesty having first been
robbed of his crown, sceptre, and orb, and other
insignia of Royalty by the Doctor-in-Law, who
hadn’t a kind word to say for his old sovereign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and who seemed positively to rejoice at his Majesty’s
downfall. I was highly indignant with
his heartless ingratitude, but could do positively
nothing, while all of my protests were drowned
in the babel of sounds made by the furious creatures
in the body of the court.</p>

<p>After being taken from the dock I was marched
off in one direction and his Majesty in another,
and the last view I had of the Wallypug was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of the poor little fellow being limply dragged
along by two Crocodiles in the direction of the
dungeons. I was conducted to the top room of a
tower, in an unfrequented part of the palace, and
there left to my reflections, without any one to
speak to for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Towards the evening I heard some shouting at
the bottom of the tower, and looking out as well
as I could through the barred window, I saw the
Doctor-in-Law rushing about with a packet of
newspapers under one arm&mdash;and heard him calling
out, in a loud voice, “Special edition! Arrest
of the Wallypug! Shocking discovery! The
Wallypug a traitor! Sister-in-Law prostrate with
excitement! The Hatless Man implicated!” He
was doing a roaring trade, as nearly everybody
was buying papers of him, and excited groups of
animals were standing about eagerly discussing
what was evidently the cause of a tremendous
sensation in the kingdom of Why.</p>

<p class="pch">FOILED!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I stood</span> at the barred window for some time,
watching the Doctor-in-Law rushing about with
his papers, and then started back as a huge and
disreputable-looking black Crow settled on the
stone ledge outside.</p>

<p>I soon recognized him as being the bird who
had behaved so impertinently to me on my first
arrival at Why.</p>

<p>“Well!” he exclaimed, squeezing himself
through the iron bars, and staring at me over
the tops of his spectacles. “You have got yourself
into a pretty muddle now, I must say. I
should think you are thoroughly ashamed of yourself,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, I’m not,” I replied. “I’m not conscious
of having done anything to be ashamed of,
and as for that trial, why it was a mere farce,
and perfectly absurd,” and I laughed heartily at
the recollection of it.</p>

<p>“H’m! I’m glad you find it so amusing,” remarked
the bird sententiously. “You won’t be
so light-hearted about it to-morrow if they treat
you as the papers say they purpose doing.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do they intend to do then?” I
exclaimed, my curiosity thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>“Execute you,” said the Crow solemnly.
“And serve you jolly well right, too.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” I cried, “they can’t execute
me for doing nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think so, do you? Didn’t you instigate
the Wallypug to become a traitor, and sell
the kingdom for the sake of a horse?” said the
Crow, referring to his paper.</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” I cried emphatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, they say you did, anyhow,” said the
Crow, “and they intend to chop off your head and
the Wallypug’s too. It won’t matter you not
having a hat then,” he continued grimly.</p>

<p>“But you don’t mean it, surely!” I exclaimed.
“They certainly can’t be so ridiculous as to treat
the affair seriously.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see,” said the bird, “things without
doubt look very black against you. In the
first place what did you want to come here at all
for?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I wish I hadn’t,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Just so! So does every one else,” said the
Crow rudely. “Then, when you did come, you
were without a hat, which is in itself a very suspicious
circumstance.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“Respectable people don’t go gadding about
without hats,” said the bird contemptuously,
turning up his beak. “And then, the first morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
after your arrival you must needs go prowling
about the grounds before any one else was
up.”</p>

     <p class="pc reduct">“WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO LEAVE ME IN YOUR WILL?”</p>
</div>

<p>“What are you going to leave me in your
will?” he continued insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” I declared. “And besides,
I’m not going to make a will. I don’t intend to
let them kill me without a good struggle, I can
tell you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“H’m, you might as well let me have your
watch and chain. It will only go to the Doctor-in-Law
if you don’t. He is sure to want to grab
everything. I expect he will want to seize the
throne when the Wallypug is executed. I saw
him just now trying on the crown, and smirking
and capering about in front of the looking-glass.”</p>

<p>“The Doctor-in-Law is an odious little monster,”
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” cried the Crow, wriggling
through the bars, “I’ll just go and tell him what
you say. I’ve no doubt he will be delighted to
hear your opinion of him&mdash;and perhaps it will induce
him to add something to your punishment.
I hope so, I’m sure&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!”</p>

<p>And the wretched ill-omened bird flew away
laughing derisively.</p>

<p>I could not help feeling rather uncomfortable
at the turn which events had taken, for there
was no knowing to what lengths the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
inhabitants of this remarkable place might
go, and if it had really been decided that the poor
Wallypug and myself should be executed on the
morrow, then there was no time to be lost in our
efforts to effect an escape.</p>

<p>I was puzzling over the matter, and wondering
what was best to be done, when I heard a bell
ringing at the other end of the apartment.</p>

<p>“Ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling,” for all the world
like the ring of a telephone call bell.</p>

<p>I ran across the room, and sure enough, there
was a telephone fitted up in the far corner. I
hastily put the receiver to my ears, and heard a
squeaky voice inquiring:</p>

<p>“Are you there? Are you 987654321?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I called out, for I thought that I might
as well be this number as any other.</p>

<p>“Well,” the voice replied, in an agitated way,
“Aunt Kesiah has done it at last.”</p>

<p>“What?” I shouted.</p>

     <p class="pf400">“Are you there?” cried A. Fish, Esq. “Yes; what is it?” I
asked.&mdash;

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Proposed to the curate, and so all those
slippers will be wasted. Don’t you think we had
better&mdash;”</p>

<p>But I rang off and stopped the connection, for
I felt sure that the communication was not intended
for me.</p>

<p>Presently there was another ring at the bell,
and this time I found myself connected with the
exchange. I knew that it was the exchange,
because they were all quarreling so.</p>

<p>“It was all your fault!” “No it wasn’t.”
“Yes it was.” “Well, you know A. Fish, Esq.,
is 13,579&mdash;so there.” “Yes, and he wanted to be
connected with the West Tower in the Palace.”</p>

<p>“Connect me with 13,579, please,” I called.</p>

<p>And a moment or two afterwards I heard a
well-known voice sounding through the instrument,
and I knew that A. Fish, Esq., was at the
other end.</p>

<p>“Are you there?” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; what is it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a biddit to spare,” he gasped;
“lift up the loose stode dear the fireplace, ad you
will find a secret staircase leadig to the dudgeod,
where the Wallypug is ibprisod; hurry for your
life, he has discovered a way of escape.”</p>

<p>I dropped the receiver, and flew to the fireplace.
Yes, sure enough, there was the loose stone that
A. Fish, Esq., had spoken of, and having raised
it with some difficulty I found a narrow spiral
staircase beneath, leading down into mysterious
depths.</p>

<p>I plunged into the darkness, and after walking
round and round, and down and down, for a considerable
time I saw a faint light at the other end.
I hurried forward as quickly as I could, and found
myself in a dimly-lighted dungeon. The Wallypug
was here alone, and was busily cramming
everything he could lay his hands on into an
enormous carpet-bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank goodness, you have come!” he exclaimed,
in a terrible fluster, when he saw me.
“I was afraid you would be too late. We must
escape at once if we would save our necks. Fortunately,
I have just remembered that this dungeon
is connected with the shute which the late
Wallypug had constructed between here and Ling
Choo, in China, which is on the other side of the
world&mdash;it is enormously long and very steep, but
quite safe&mdash;we must use it in order to get
away. We are to be executed in the morning if
we stay here, so I am informed; therefore, we
must lose no time. I have just finished packing
up. Ah! What’s that?” he exclaimed, listening
intently.</p>

<p>“Quick! they are coming!” he cried, as sounds
were heard in the passage outside the dungeon
door; and touching a spring, an enormous opening
appeared in the wall. His Majesty gave me
a sudden push, which sent me sprawling on to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
smooth and very steep incline, and jumping down
himself, we slid rapidly away into the unknown.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""

     <p class="pc reduct">WE SLID RAPIDLY DOWN THE SHUTE.</p>
</div>

<p>That we were only just in time was evidenced
by the cries of rage and disappointment which
pursued us from the dungeon, as the Doctor-in-Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the other creatures saw us escape from
their clutches, and we could hear the Cockatoo’s
shrill cries grow fainter and fainter as we sped
swiftly down the shute towards Ling Choo.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE LITTLE BLUE PEOPLE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span>, and down, and down we flew, quicker
and quicker each moment. The shute was as
smooth as glass, and grew steeper than ever as
we descended. His Majesty was a little way behind
me, but the terrific rate at which we were
traveling made it impossible for us to hold any
conversation. Once or twice I shouted out something
to him, but receiving no reply I soon gave
that up. The attitude in which I was slipping
down the shute was a most uncomfortable one,
but after a considerable time I managed to turn
over on to my back, and eventually to twist
around, till, at any rate, I was traveling feet foremost,
which was some slight consolation, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
naturally I was dreadfully concerned as to what
was to be our fate at the other end of our journey.
“Slipping along at this rate,” I thought, “we
shall probably be smashed to a jelly when we do
arrive at the bottom. At any rate I shall, for the
Wallypug and the carpet-bag are bound to descend
upon my devoted head.”</p>

<p>By and by I began to grow very hungry, and
then came another dismal thought. Supposing
this extraordinary trip continued for any length
of time, how should we get on for food?</p>

<p>We seemed to be traveling through a kind of
tunnel, with very smooth walls on either side.
The Wallypug had said that we were bound for
China, and that that country was on the other
side of the world. If so, then we were in for a
pretty long journey. I twisted my head around,
and tried to get a glimpse of his Majesty, who
was only a few yards above me. I could see that
he was struggling to get something out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
carpet-bag, and a few minutes afterwards a little
packet of sandwiches came whizzing past my
head. I managed to catch it as it fell upon the
highly-polished boards by stretching out one leg
just in time to prevent it from slipping too far.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-096.jpg" width="300" height="355"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc reduct">I COULD SEE HE WAS STRUGGLING TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF
THE CARPET-BAG.</p>
</div>

<p>The sandwiches were very good, and I enjoyed
them immensely, and for a few moments almost
forgot our strange surroundings. I was soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
however, recalled to a sense of our condition by
the fact that we suddenly emerged from the tunnel
into broad daylight, the shute apparently descending
the steep sides of a high mountain. As
soon as my eyes became accustomed to the light
I noticed, to my great surprise, that everything
in this new country was of a deep rich blue color.
The rocks on the mountain side, the strange-looking
trees, and even the birds&mdash;of which I could
see several flying about&mdash;were all of the same
unusual tint.</p>

<p>I had hardly noticed this fact, as we flew down
the side of the mountain, when I felt myself suddenly
pulled up with a jerk, and lifted high into
the air in a most unaccountable manner, and
when, after a moment or two, I recovered from
the shock, I found that both the Wallypug and
myself were suspended from a line at the end of
two long fishing-rods which were fastened into a
quaint little bridge crossing the shute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>There we hung, dangling and bobbing about
in front of each other in the most ridiculous way,
the dear Wallypug still clinging to his carpet-bag
with one hand, while in the other he clutched a
half-eaten sandwich. I shall never forget his
Majesty’s surprised expression when he found
himself hanging up the air in this unexpected way.</p>

<p>“Like being a bird, isn’t it?” he remarked
when at last he found a voice.</p>

<p>“H’m, not much,” I replied. “I feel more
like a fish at the end of this line. I wish some
one would come and help us off. There’s a hook,
or something, sticking into my shoulder, and it
hurts no end.” You see there was evidently
something at the end of the lines which had caught
into our clothes, and the hook, or whatever it
was, just touched my shoulder. It did not hurt
very much, but just enough to make me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I wonder where we are,” said the Wallypug,
looking about him. “What a funny color everything
is, to be sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it?” I replied. And truly it was
a most remarkable scene. There was a curious
little kind of temple in the distance and a number
of most extraordinary-looking trees; and these,
and the grass, and, in fact, everything that could
be seen, were of a bright blue tint.</p>

<p>“I know what those trees are called,” said the
Wallypug, pointing to some remarkable looking
ones, with a lot of large blue globes on the branches
instead of leaves.</p>

<p>“What?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Gombobble trees,” said his Majesty. “I’ve
seen pictures of them before.”</p>

<p>“Where?” I asked, more for the sake of something
to say than for anything else.</p>

<p>“On our willow-pattern plates at home,” said
his Majesty. “There were those and the wiggle-woggely
trees, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder,” he continued speculatively, “if
by any chance we are there.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I wonder if this is the place which is shown
on the willow-pattern plates,” said his Majesty.</p>

<p>Before I could reply we heard an excited exclamation
from the bank, and turning around as well
as we could we saw two curious little blue people
dressed in flowing blue costumes.</p>

<p>“Oh!” they exclaimed, when they saw us,
throwing up their hands in a comical little way,
“we’ve caught something. What funny things!
What are they?”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they bite,” cried the shorter of the
two.</p>

<p>“Do you bite, you funny things, you?” cried
the other, shaking her head at us.</p>

<p>“No, of course not,” said the Wallypug.
“Help us to get down, will you, please?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said both of the little blue creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
shaking their heads simultaneously. “What are
your names?”</p>

<p>“He, he, he! He, he, he! He, he, he!” giggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the little blue people. “They’re Wallypugs.
Two great big fat Wallypugs. Oh, oh! what

they ran off as fast as their little blue legs would
carry them.</p>

<p class="pch">THE WALLYPUG RECOVERS HIS CROWN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> Majesty and myself stared at each other
in dismay. Our position was growing more and
more uncomfortable every moment, and, added
to this, I had a growing impression that the
rods to which we were attached would sooner or
later break with our weight.</p>

<p>“Well! I do think that they might have helped
us off the hooks, at any rate,” grumbled his
Majesty, discontentedly.</p>

<p>“So do I,” I rejoined, and was about to add
something else when my attention was attracted
to the peculiar behavior of the two blue birds
which we had previously noticed circling about
over our heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>They were wheeling round and round in a most
eccentric manner, and as they drew closer we
could see that they were as singular in appearance
as they were in their manner.</p>

<p>“Why, they’ve got ever so many wings!”
cried his Majesty in surprise.</p>

<p>“Go away!” he shouted, as one of them fluttered
past his face. The birds, however, were not to
be got rid of so easily, and, uttering shrill little
cries, they hovered about over his Majesty’s
head, every now and then making a vicious
dart at the sandwich which he still held in one
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh! take them away!&mdash;take them away!” he
shouted, dropping his carpet-bag in alarm, and evidently
forgetting that I was as incapable as he
was of driving them off.</p>

<p>“Throw your sandwich away!” I shouted;
“it’s that they are after, I believe.”</p>

<p>His Majesty did so, and we soon had the satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of seeing the birds squabbling over it on
the bank at the side of the shute.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc reduct">“GO AWAY!” SHOUTED HIS MAJESTY.</p>
</div>

<p>“Fortunate I tied my bag to the string of my
cloak, wasn’t it?” remarked the Wallypug, when
they had gone. “I should have lost it else. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
look! What’s that coming down the shute?” he
cried, as something suddenly came rolling and
bounding down the steep incline.</p>

<p>“O&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;h!” he continued delightedly, as
it stopped, caught in the mouth of the carpet-bag
which, attached to the cord of his Majesty’s cloak,
dangled down the shute. “Why, it’s my crown!
They must have thought that I wanted it, and
sent it down after me. How very kind of them.
Wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>I had my own opinions on the subject, and held
my peace, for I felt quite sure that it was not
through any intentional kindness that the crown
had found its way to its proper owner.</p>

<p>His Majesty very carefully drew up the carpet-bag
with its precious burden, and soon had the intense
satisfaction of putting the crown of Why on
his royal head once more.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he cried with a little sigh of satisfaction,
“it does seem nice to have it on again. I’m afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that I should soon have
caught a cold in my head,
like A. Fish, Esq., if I
had gone without it
much longer.”</p>

     <p class="pc reduct">A LONG LINE OF CREATURES WAS<br />
COMING DOWN THE SHUTE.</p>
</div>

<p>“Gracious!” he cried,
pointing excitedly towards
the top of the
shute, “there’s something
else coming down!
Why it’s the Doctor-in-Law
and Madame. Oh!&mdash;and
the Cockatoo&mdash;and&mdash;the
Rabbit and the
Mole. Bless me! if the
whole of Why isn’t coming
along.”</p>
<p>It was quite true; attached
to a strong rope
a long line of creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was coming down the shute, the Doctor-in-Law
leading the way.</p>

<p>He soon caught sight of us dangling at the end
of our rods, and calling out “Halt!” in a loud
voice, he pulled at the rope as a sign that they
were to stop. This signal was passed along by the
others, and the Cockatoo, who was attached to the
rope in a very uncomfortable manner, gave a loud
“squ-a-a-k” as the sudden jerk caused it to
tighten about her neck.</p>

<p>The signal, however, managed somehow to
reach those at the other end, for the procession
suddenly came to a standstill.</p>

<p>“Oh, there you are then!” called out the Doctor-in-Law
in a severe voice. “Thought you had
escaped us, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The Cockatoo, in a voice choking with rage, and
the tightened rope, shrieked out, “Down with the
traitors!” while the Rabbit passed the word
along, “It’s all right. We’ve found them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just you come down and tie yourself to this
rope at once!” called out Madame, glaring
fiercely at the Wallypug.</p>

<p>“Shan’t!” shouted his Majesty defiantly, pushing
his crown further on to his head.</p>

<p>“What!” screamed the good lady, in a terrible
passion. “Do you dare to rebel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” called out his Majesty bravely.
“I don’t believe you are my sister-in-law at all,
and I’m not going back to Why to be snubbed and
ill-treated for you or any one else&mdash;so there. You
can’t get at me, hanging up here, and I don’t
mean to get down till you’re gone. Yah!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll soon see all about that,” called out
the Doctor-in-Law, working himself to the edge
of the shute, and trying to climb up the steep
sides of the bank.</p>

<p>We watched his endeavors with considerable
anxiety, for if he did succeed in getting on to the
bank, it would be an easy matter for him to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
at us, by means of the bridge. The rope, however,
by which he was attached to the Sister-in-Law
was not sufficiently long to enable him to do
this, and while he was unfastening it there was
a sudden cry in the direction of the tunnel, and
a moment afterwards, screaming, kicking, and
struggling, the whole party rapidly disappeared
down the shute.</p>

<p>The rope had given way!</p>

<p>“He, he, he! Ha, ha!” laughed his Majesty,
as the huddled mass vanished in the distance.
“What a lark! Oh what a muddle they will be
in when they reach the bottom.”</p>

<p>I tried to imagine what would be the result, and
came to the conclusion that, uncomfortable as I
was in my present position, I would rather be
where I was than attached to the rope with the
others.</p>

<p>In the meantime the little blue people, their
curiosity evidently aroused by the noise, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hurrying towards us as quickly as possible, bringing
with them a very stout blue person, who was
waddling along, being alternately pushed and
pulled by the others in their eagerness to reach us.</p>

<p>“See, there they are!” cried the little lady
whose name we afterwards found out was Gra-Shus.
“Oh my! Aren’t they a funny color?”</p>

<p>“Shall we get them down?” asked the other,
whose name was Mi-Hy.</p>

<p>The little fat man regarded us critically, and
said nothing for a moment or two, then he nodded
his head violently.</p>

<p>“You’re sure you won’t bite?” said Mi-Hy,
looking up into my face.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. Don’t be silly,” I replied.</p>

<p>Thereupon, after a great deal of pulling and
pushing on the part of Mi-Hy and Gra-Shus, the
rods to which we were attached were swung
around, and the Wallypug and myself alighted,
one on either side of the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>His Majesty smoothed his rumpled garments,
and, adjusting his crown to a more becoming
angle, positively swaggered across the bridge to
where the three little blue people stood in a line
to receive us.</p>

<p>“This is Ho-Lor,” said Mi-Hy, pushing the little
fat man forward, while Gra-Shus bashfully hid
behind the ample folds of his gorgeous blue skirts.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” asked his Majesty graciously.</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Ho-Lor, smilingly.</p>

<p>“I mean, how are you?” explained the Wallypug.</p>

<p>“You mean <i>what</i> am I, I suppose?” said the
little man, putting on a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said the Wallypug. “I mean
just what I say&mdash;How are you?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand,” replied Ho-Lor.
“How am I what?”</p>

<p>“His Majesty the Wallypug of Why,” I explained,
“wishes to say, that he hopes you are
quite well.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg your pardon” said Ho-Lor. “How
very stupid of me. But you know, the fact is,
we get such a lot of foreigners down here, and
they do ask such funny questions. A Frenchman
we caught the other day actually asked me
how I carried myself. Wasn’t it rude of him&mdash;considering
my weight too?”</p>

<p>“You’re a Wallypug, too, aren’t you?” asked
Gra-Shus, looking smilingly up into my face.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” I replied; “I am only his Majesty’s
guest.”</p>

<p>“His Majesty! Do you mean that?” said Mi-Hy,
pointing to the Wallypug.</p>

<p>The Wallypug drew himself up with an air of
offended dignity.</p>

<p>“I am not a ‘that’; I’m a kind of a king,”
he explained, in a tone of remonstrance.</p>

<p>“O-ooh!” exclaimed the little blue people, falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
down on their knees and bowing their foreheads
to the ground, with their hands stretched
out before them. “Pray forgive us, Majestuous
Wallypug, we thought you were only an ordinary
person. You see we’ve never caught a king before.
Oh! don’t chop our heads off, will you?”</p>

don’t they?” cried the little people, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh dear no,” said the Wallypug.</p>

<p>“Get up; or you’ll spoil your clothes. Could
we have a cup of tea, please? We are rather
fatigued with our long journey.”</p>

<p>The little blue people immediately jumped up
and led the way to where behind a clump of
curious blue trees the quaintest little boat you
could possibly imagine was moored against the
bank. A blue lake stretched as far as the eye
could reach, and a number of little islands were
dotted about it. On one, a little larger than the
rest, a quaint little blue pagoda could be seen.</p>

<p class="pch">THE HOME OF HO-LOR.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I live</span> over there,” said Ho-Lor with pride,
pointing to the island with the pagoda on it.
“Mi-Hy shall row us across, and Gra-Shus shall
make us some tea.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” said Gra-Shus clapping her hands.
“And we’ll show Mr. Majesty Wallypug our
beautiful pet dog&mdash;won’t we?”</p>

<p>It was impossible not to be interested in these
quaint and simple-minded little folk, and after
we had all stepped into the little boat and Mi-Hy
had pushed off, his Majesty was soon chatting
affably with Ho-Lor, who explained that he was
a mandarin of the Blue Button, and ninety-eighth-cousin-twice-removed
to the Emperor of China.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>We soon reached the opposite bank, and his
Majesty having been ceremoniously assisted out
of the boat, we ascended a slight hill, and soon
found ourselves before Ho-Lor’s residence. To
our great surprise we found that it exactly resembled
the building so familiar to all who have
seen a willow-pattern plate.</p>

<p>The tall pillars at the portico, the quaintly-shaped
curly roofs, the little zig-zag fence running
along the path, and the curious trees, all
seemed to be old friends&mdash;while two little islands,
one of which was connected to the mainland by
a quaint bridge, completed the picture.</p>

<p>The two birds, which had by this time finished
squabbling about the sandwich, were billing and
cooing over our heads, and the sight of them
seemed suddenly to convince us of the identity of
the spot.</p>

<p>“Why, this must be the land of the Willow-pattern
plate,” cried his Majesty excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” admitted Ho-Lor. “Don’t you
think it is a very pretty spot?”</p>

<p>“Charming,” declared the Wallypug; “I have
often wanted to come here.”</p>

<p>“The real name of the place,” said Ho-Lor, “is
Wer-har-wei, and it is a portion of China; but
come, you must see our little dog; I can hear
that Mi-Hy has gone to fetch him.”</p>

<p>“His name is Kis-Smee,” said Gra-Shus, “and
he is such a dear old thing. We’ve had him ever
since he was a puppy.”</p>

<p>There was a sound of barking, and a confused
clattering of chains, which told of a dog being
unloosed. A moment afterwards there came
bounding out of the house the most extraordinary-looking
creature that I have ever beheld.</p>

<p>It was a very fat and atrociously hideous animal,
bearing but slight resemblance to a dog. Its
enormous mouth wore a perpetual grin, and was
decorated at the corners with curious little scallops.
It was bandy-legged, and its hinder legs
were much longer than the front ones. Added
to this, the skin on its haunches was wrinkled up
into curious kind of rosettes, while its tail was
really all sorts of shapes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>This beautiful creature came careering down
the steps, dragging Mi-Hy with him, and was
hailed with delight by Gra-Shus, who cried in
endearing tones:</p>

<p>“Come along, good dog! Come and speak to
the pretty Wallypugs. Good Kis-Smee. Good
dog, then!”</p>

<p>His Majesty clutched my arm nervously, and
retreating behind the carpet-bag, regarded Kis-Smee
with a certain amount of suspicion, while I
must confess to having experienced a slight feeling
of uneasiness myself. For if Kis-Smee took
it into his ugly head to object to us, there was no
knowing what might be the result.</p>

<p>There was no occasion for alarm, however, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Kis-Smee turned out to be one of the mildest and
best-behaved of dogs.</p>

<p>He made great friends with the Wallypug at
once, and clumsily gamboled, or, as his Majesty
explained it, “flumped,” about him in the most
friendly manner.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t take to strangers as a rule,” said
Ho-Lor, “but he certainly seems to have taken a
fancy to you.”</p>

<p>“He is a beautiful creature,” said his Majesty,
politely patting the huge animal a little nervously.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know about that,” remarked
Ho-Lor, looking very pleased nevertheless. “He
is of a very rare breed, though.”</p>

<p>“What kind of dog do you call him?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>“He’s a smirkler dog,” replied Ho-Lor
proudly.</p>

<p>“A what?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“A smirkler. He smirkles for mivlets you
know,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Good gracious. What are they?” cried the
Wallypug.</p>

<p>“Mivlets?” asked Ho-Lor.</p>

<p>“Why young mivs, of course.”</p>

<p>“But what are mivs?” asked his Majesty
curiously.</p>

<p>“Things that are smirkled for,” replied Ho-Lor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
promptly. “But come. I see that Gra-Shus
has prepared some tea for us.”</p>

<p>We entered the little blue temple and were
each presented with a little blue rug, upon which
we sat cross-legged, as we observed that Mi-Hy
and Ho-Lor were doing. Gra-Shus served us in
blue cups what tasted like delicious tea, but which
looked exactly like blue ink. No sooner had we
taken a few sips than I noticed that the Wallypug
was slowly turning a light blue color, while
at the same moment he stared at me fixedly a
moment, and then exclaimed: “Why, what a
funny color you are!”</p>

<p>I looked at my hands, and found them a rich
blue shade.</p>

<p>“We look like the Oxford and Cambridge boat
race, don’t we?” he continued: “I’m so glad
that I’m Cambridge!”</p>

<p>I did not at all approve of the change, for
although we did not look so very remarkable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the midst of our strange surroundings, I could
not help thinking what an extraordinary object
I should be considered in London if I ever reached
that place again.</p>

<p>“Oh! Aren’t they pretty now?” exclaimed
Gra-Shus, clapping her hands and dancing about
excitedly.</p>

<p>“I am glad you think so,” I replied, in a huff.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like it? Would you rather have
been green? We’ve plenty of green tea, you
know, if you wish.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! I should prefer being my original
color, if you don’t mind,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Dear me! I’m very sorry, but I’m afraid
we’re out of that color. Let’s see! Crushed
strawberry, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! let’s stay blue for a little while,” pleaded
his Majesty. “It’s such a change, and so very
uncommon, you know!”</p>

<p>So blue we remained, and directly after we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
finished our tea Mi-Hy brought around the little
blue boat again, and we went for a row on the
ornamental lake.</p>

<p>Somehow or another Kis-Smee was left behind,
and although the Wallypug suggested putting
back for him, it was finally decided, however, not
to do so.</p>

<p>And I confidently hoped that he might do so,
for I was as curious as was the Wallypug to know
what the term meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then we passed a curious little blue island
with one tiny house on it, standing in the midst
of some curious trees and strangely-shaped rocks.
“Let’s go ashore and fish,” suddenly suggested
Mi-Hy.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, do,” cried the Wallypug. “I love
fishing; but I’m never allowed to do so in my
own land.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” inquired Ho-Lor.</p>

<p>“The fishes object,” replied his Majesty,
sadly; “they say that it gives them the tooth-ache.”</p>

<p>“How absurd of them,” said Ho-Lor, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Yes; isn’t it perfectly ridiculous?” replied
his Majesty; “for they really haven’t any teeth,
you know.”</p>

<p>By this time the boat had reached the shore,
and we all scrambled out and assisted Ho-Lor up
the steep rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>From within the little blue house Mi-Hy
brought some rods and lines, and we began to
fish. There was no bait of any kind, but this
Ho-Lor explained was not necessary.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I was not surprised
to find that we did not get a bite for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>At last, however, the Wallypug announced
with a delighted shout, “I’ve got one!” and we
all ran over to see what it was.</p>

<p>Slowly his Majesty wound up his line, while
Mi-Hy hung over the rocks with a landing net.
“I’ve got it!” he shouted. “Oh, what a
beauty!” and diving his hand into the net, he
drew out&mdash;what do you think? An empty ink-bottle!</p>

<p>I couldn’t help laughing at his Majesty’s
disappointed face, but Ho-Lor seemed positively
to think that it was a catch worth having. “It’s
in capital condition,” he exclaimed, examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
it critically, “and has a beautifully-shaped
neck.”</p>

<p>“But it’s only an old ink bottle,” objected the
poor Wallypug.</p>

<p>“What else did you expect to catch, I should
like to know?” said Mi-Hy. “Some people are
never satisfied. Many a time I have fished here
a whole day and only caught a piece of blotting
paper or a pen-wiper.”</p>

<p>“What funny things to catch!” exclaimed
the Wallypug.</p>

<p>“They are very appropriate things to get
from a lake of ink,” said Ho-Lor rather huffily.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m sure I beg your pardon, I had no
idea it was real ink,” said his Majesty, apologetically.
“I don’t think we had better fish any
longer,” he said putting away his rod. “I hoped
to have caught some real fish, you know.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of them. What are they?”
asked Ho-Lor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, things with scales, you know,” exclaimed
the Wallypug.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean weighing machines,” said
Mi-Hy.</p>

<p>“No! no! I mean&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hark! what’s that?” said Ho-Lor, putting
his hand to his ear.</p>

<p>“Come on! That’s Kis-Smee barking. I
expect he has smirkled a mivlet. Come along,
hurry up, or we shall be too late.”</p>

<p>We hurriedly launched the little boat, and
were soon on our way across the little lake.</p>

<p>The sound of furious barking, mingled with
a strangely familiar voice, came from behind
Ho-Lor’s house, and hurrying forward we came
suddenly upon a remarkable sight.</p>

<p>Kis-Smee was prancing madly round a gombobble
tree to the lower branches of which
A. Fish, Esq., was clinging in an agony of
fright.</p>

<p>“Lie dowd, sir! Lie dowd, good dog, thed!”
he shouted, while Kis-Smee barked and made
sudden furious little darts at the fish’s tail.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s A. Fish, Esq.,” cried his Majesty,
hurrying forward anxiously. “Come away,
Kis-Smee! Lie down, sir!”</p>

<p>Kis-Smee left his quarry in the tree, and came
bounding up to the Wallypug, wagging his great
clumsy tail delightedly.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mi-Hy, staring
in amazement at A. Fish, Esq. “That’s not
a mivlet, I’m sure&mdash;what on earth is the
creature?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s A. Fish, Esq., a great friend of
mine,” hastily explained his Majesty, running to
his assistance, for when Kis-Smee had left him,
poor A. Fish, Esq., had dropped off the gombobble
tree, and was now lying exhausted on the blue
grass beneath.</p>

<p>“What a dreadful bodster!” he cried, waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Kis-Smee off as we approached. “Keep hib off.
Take hib away!”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said his Majesty, reassuringly,
“he won’t bite you now that we are here.”</p>

<p>Indeed, directly the dog discovered that A.
Fish, Esq., was a friend of the Wallypug’s, he
went up to him, and grinning in an absurd way,
held out a paw to be shaken, which favor, however,
was declined by A. Fish, Esq., who evidently
regarded these overtures with a certain amount
of suspicion, and looked greatly relieved when
Ho-Lor and Mi-Hy, seeing that we were engaged
with a friend, considerately left us to ourselves,
and took Kis-Smee away with them.</p>

<p class="pch">THE WHY AND WER-HAR-WEI RAILWAY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Fancy</span> seeing you!” cried his Majesty, as
we sat down beside the Fish under the gombobble
tree. “How ever did you get here? And what’s
the news at Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, thad’s a log story,” said A. Fish, Esq.,
and proceeded to tell us how that after we had
escaped from Why, by means of the shute, there
had been a great commotion in the place, and the
Doctor-in-Law was furious. He declared that we
should not slip through his hands in this way,
and had a long conversation with the Sister-in-Law
and the others as to the best way of affecting
our capture. Finally they decided to attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
themselves to a long rope, and come down the
shute in pursuit of us.</p>

<p>A. Fish, Esq., made the excuse that his cold was
too bad to permit him to join the party, and
waited till they had got a good way down,
and then cut the rope. He thought that
this would be the best way of being of service
to us. And so it was, of course, for goodness
only knows where our pursuers were by
this time.</p>

<p>A little while after he had cut the rope A. Fish,
Esq., came across the Crow, who told him that
he had been informed by two duffer birds (which
was the name of the curious blue birds which we
had noticed) that we were here at Wer-har-wei,
and had immediately set about to discover the
best way to get here.</p>

<p>He went in the first place to the station-master
at Why, and found him, as usual, engaged in
squabbling with the porter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>They were arguing as to whether a certain signal
should be up or down.</p>

<p>The station-master declared that the signal
should always be up on the up line and down on
the down line. This the porter would not agree
to, so it was at last decided to put one up and one
down and leave them so, and then the engine-drivers
could do as they pleased about going on or
stopping.</p>

     <p class="pc reduct">AS USUAL THE STATION-MASTER WAS SQUABBLING WITH THE PORTER.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had quite settled this dispute,
A. Fish, Esq., had asked them if there were any
trains running between Why and this place, and
at first they had said no; but presently the porter
remembered that there was a certain train which
started on some days and went no one knew
where.</p>

<p>No one was ever known to travel by it, and the
engine-driver, who was an old salamander by the
name of Mike, was deaf and dumb, and could
neither read nor write, so that they had never
been able to find out from him where his train
went to. It had some letters on it which corresponded
with those on the station-master’s collar,
but no one had ever been able to discover what
they meant. They were popularly supposed to
stand for Weary Waiting and Horribly Wobbly
Railway, the initials on the station-master’s collar
being W.W.H.W.R., but A. Fish, Esq., had
by a brilliant inspiration come to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that they stood for Why and Wer-har-wei Railway,
and when the train, which consisted of only
one carriage and the engine, came into the station,
he jumped in, to the intense surprise of Mike, who
had never had a passenger before, and who in his
agitation recklessly put two shovelfuls of coal into
the furnace, and, giving a frantic “toot” on the
whistle, started off at full speed.</p>

<p>“It was a dreadful journey,” said A. Fish, Esq.,
“ad I dever had so bedy ups and dowds id all by
life.”</p>

<p>We didn’t quite understand what he meant by
this at the moment, but a little later on we discovered
the reason to our cost.</p>

<p>After an eventful journey, A. Fish, Esq., had
arrived at this place, and had found on alighting
from the train that no one was to be seen, and he
was just about to kick at the door of Ho-Lor’s
house when Kis-Smee came bounding out. Poor
A. Fish, Esq., had been terribly alarmed, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
made for the nearest tree, and was vainly trying
to climb up into it when we made our appearance.</p>

<p>“If I were you,” he advised, “I should certaidly
cub back to Why at odce, for the people all
seeb to be rejoiced thad Madame and the Doctor-id-Law
have gode away, ad I think thad they
would willingly forgive you for having said, ‘Ad
horse! ad horse! by kigdob for ad horse!’”</p>

<p>After talking the matter over for a few minutes
we decided that perhaps it would be the best thing
to do, and as the little blue station was only just
at the back of Ho-Lor’s house we thought that
perhaps by hurrying we should catch the same
train back to Why by which A. Fish, Esq., had
come. So we set out to try and find the little blue
people, to bid them “good-by,” and thank them
for their hospitality.</p>

<p>We found them at the station sitting beside
Mike, to whom it appeared they were in the habit
of being very kind on his occasional visits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>They seemed quite sorry to hear that we were
leaving them so soon, and insisted upon making
the Wallypug a present of Kis-Smee, and of stuffing
into my pocket an enormous gombobble as a
souvenir of my visit. Then there was just time
to look at the “train” before we started. I must
say that of all crazy, ramshackle affairs it was
quite the worst that I had ever seen. To begin
with, the wheels were all sorts of shapes, and not
one of them was quite round. There was only
one compartment, and that had no windows in it.
And the engine! Well, it was something like
Puffing Billy, only a little worse.</p>

<p>There was no room for Kis-Smee in the carriage,
so we were obliged to chain him up on the roof,
evidently much to his disgust.</p>

<p>I must confess to a certain feeling of uneasiness
when, having taken our seats, the engine gave a
snort, and puffing out a volume of dense black
smoke and smuts, started us on our journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>By reason of the odd shape of our wheels and
the unevenness of the rails the carriage pitched
and tossed about like a ship at sea, and our passage
over a little wooden viaduct, where on either
side the little blue people stood waving their
adieux with quaint little flags, was, I am convinced,
attended with considerable danger.</p>

<p>It was really a dreadful journey. The carriage
pitched backward and forward, and rolled from
side to side with every revolution of the wheels,
while poor Kis-Smee, on the top, kept slipping
about in the most painful manner. His Majesty’s
carpet-bag, which had not been securely fastened
to the top of the carriage, slipped off soon after
we started, and though we rang the bell violently
Mike refused to stop, and it was lost forever.</p>

<p>“Fortunately there was not much in it!” his
Majesty gasped between the jerks which the
irregular motion of the train occasioned. “Only
a tooth-brush and small cake of soap.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“But it felt quite full,” I remarked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes,” explained his Majesty. “I stuffed it
full of paper and things, because I thought that
it would look so bad for a king to be traveling
about without any luggage.”</p>

<p>Just then there was a yelp and a howl from
Kis-Smee, and looking out of the window we found
that the poor creature had fallen from the roof
and was hanging down by the chain which was
attached to the top of the carriage, and was in
momentary danger of being strangled.</p>

<p>We managed, after a prolonged struggle, to
haul him in through the window, and, although
we were rather crowded, to find room for him in
the carriage. We had hardly settled down into
our places, however, before the train came to a
standstill, and Mike came to the door in a great
state of agitation.</p>

<p>“Av yez plaze, sor,” he began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why! I thought you were deaf and dumb,”
I cried.</p>

<p>“Och&mdash;that’s all gammon sure&mdash;oi can talk all
roight, and hear all roight too when it suits me
purpose. Well, now, ye see when the dog fell off
the roof he upset me coal-scuttle, and never a bit
of coal is there left. Would ye be good enough,
kind gentlemen, to go back and pick some up off
the line, it’s only about a moile and a half
back.”</p>

<p>The engine, it appeared, could not be reversed,
and, as there was no chance of getting a supply
anywhere else, nothing remained but for his
Majesty and myself to go back with the coal-scuttle
and pick some of the spilt coal up.</p>

<p>Kis-Smee bounded delightedly at our side; but
we did not take A. Fish, Esq., with us, as he complained
of a pain in his tail, and we feared that
the long walk might make it worse.</p>

<p>“I shall amuse byself while you are away by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
giving Bike ad elocutiod lessod,” he said, as we
left him.</p>

<p>But Mike, who was undoing his bundle preparatory
to having some dinner, did not look very
enthusiastic over the project, and I am almost
certain I heard him mutter, “Not if I know it,”
as we were walking away.</p>

<p>We found the coal, as we expected, beside the
line, after we had walked a little over a mile, and
his Majesty and myself picked it up, and packing
it in the scuttle, took turns in carrying it back to
the train again.</p>

<p>We had nearly arrived at the spot where the
train was waiting for us, when his Majesty
noticed some curious flowers growing in a little
copse beside the line, and we put down our coal-scuttle
and went to gather them. While we were
doing so, however, we heard a wild shout, and
looking up beheld an enormously tall and thin
man running towards us, gesticulating violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>He was waving some wire and leather dog
muzzles in one hand.</p>

     <p class="pc reduct">THE TALL THIN MAN WAS WAVING SOME MUZZLES.</p>
</div>

<p>“Where’s his muzzle?” he demanded, pointing
to Kis-Smee. “Can’t you see the dog is mad and
must be muzzled immediately?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sure he’s not,” cried the Wallypug, indignantly,
and patting Kis-Smee’s head.</p>

<p>“He is,” declared the man. “All dogs are
mad, and I insist upon them being muzzled.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I interposed. “You had better
try and put a muzzle on this one yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll soon do that,” cried the man, selecting
a large muzzle from the collection which he
carried with him. “Come here, sir! Good dog,
then.”</p>

<p>Kis-Smee growled, and grinning more than
ever made a dart at the man, who dropped his
muzzles and fled, screaming, “Mad dog! Mad
dog!” at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>His Majesty and myself, laughing heartily at
his discomfiture, hurried back to the train without
meeting with any further adventures.</p>

<p>A. Fish, Esq., and Mike seemed to be rather
cool towards each other, I thought, and I heard
afterwards that they had not got on at all well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
with the “elocution” lesson&mdash;in fact, Mike had
absolutely refused to be instructed in that very
necessary art.</p>

<p>Of course we told them of our adventure with
the man in the wood, and Mike explained that he
was well known as “The Long Man of Muzzledom,”
and was quite harmless, though rather
silly, being under the impression that all dogs and
cats were mad and should be muzzled.</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t muzzle Kis-Smee, anyhow,”
said his Majesty, as we took our seats in the
carriage, and the train once more started for
Why.</p>

<p>After several hours of bumping and jolting, we
were delighted to see the familiar towers and
gables of his Majesty’s palace in the distance, and
knew that we had at last arrived at the end of
our journey.</p>

<p class="pch">BACK AGAIN AT WHY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kis-smee</span> was overjoyed to get out of the train,
and eagerly strained at the chain which his
Majesty had affixed to his collar, in his endeavor
to get through the barrier.</p>

<p>The porter, however, who pretended not to
know us, demanded our tickets.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” said his Majesty, smilingly.
“I’m the Wallypug, you know.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said the porter. “The Wallypug
was ugly enough, goodness knows, but he
hadn’t a <i>blue</i> face like you; besides, Wallypug
or no Wallypug, you don’t get through here without
a ticket, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>Here was a pretty pickle. We had not thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in the least about tickets, and in fact had no idea
that any would be required.</p>

<p>“I certainly shan’t let you pass the barrier
without,” said the porter, in answer to our explanations.</p>

<p>“But what are we to do?” asked the Wallypug.
“Can’t we pay at this end?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. My instructions are to demand
a ticket of every one passing this barrier,
and unless you give me one you cannot go
through.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you we haven’t any. Can’t you
tell us what to do?”</p>

<p>“Go back for them, I should say,” said the
porter, yawning unconcernedly. “Now then,
one thing or another. Are you going to give me
the tickets or not?”</p>

<p>“How can we give them to you if we haven’t
any?” demanded the Wallypug. The porter
slammed the door to impatiently, and went a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
little way up the platform, turning around to call
out warningly, “If we find any suspicious-looking
characters hanging about the station premises
we shoot them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>No one answered for a few minutes, but
eventually a door some little distance up the
platform opened, and the old station-master
made his appearance, puffing and blowing, and
followed by the porter, carrying a huge blunderbuss.</p>

<p>“Now then, what’s all this noise about?” he
demanded.</p>

Wallypug.</p>

<p>“We are very sorry,” I began in explanation.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, and speak when you are
spoken to,” interrupted the station-master.</p>

<p>“Where are your tickets?”</p>

<p>“They haven’t any,” explained the porter
officiously. “They are trying to defraud the
company.”</p>

<p>“H’m, funny-looking lot of people, too,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the station-master. “Who are they, do
you know?”</p>

<p>“That,” said the porter, pointing to his
Majesty, “says he is the Wallypug.”</p>

<p>“What! <i>that</i> color!” objected the station-master.
“The Wallypug! Indeed, what nonsense!”</p>

<p>“But, indeed, I am the Wallypug,” declared
his Majesty, “and we turned this color after
we drank the tea, you know.”</p>

<p>“Turned blue through drinking tea!” said the
station-master incredulously.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! a <i>likely</i> story,” laughed the porter
derisively.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will wear off in time,” said the
Wallypug, “like being sunburnt does.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, you had better stop here till
it does,” said the station-master. “Look here!”
he cried, turning to the porter, “you stop here at
the barrier, and don’t let them through until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
have turned a respectable color, and you can recognize
them.”</p>

<p>“But it may take weeks,” began his Majesty.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue!” said the station-master
sharply. “If you have any nonsense with them,
shoot them,” he added to the porter, depositing
the blunderbuss beside the barrier, and going
back to the other end of the platform.</p>

<p>Whatever we should have done I cannot think,
if just at that moment the porter’s wife had not
put her head out of the signal-box and called to
him to “come in at once and mind the baby,”
while she “did a little shopping.”</p>

<p>“But he’s on duty, ma’am,” expostulated the
station-master.</p>

<p>“I don’t care anything about <i>that;</i> you come
in at once, Bill,” shouted the woman, and the
porter meekly left the barrier and disappeared
within the signal-box.</p>

<p>Of course we all rushed through the gate at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
once, and the station-master catching sight of
Kis-Smee, who had meanwhile slipped his chain,
fled up the platform in dismay.</p>

<p>Kis-Smee, evidently thinking him fair game,
started off in pursuit, and it was not till the station-master
had bolted into his office and locked
the door that we could get him to come back to
our call.</p>

<p>So soon as we got into the street we met the
Turtle and the Pelican, walking arm-in-arm, and
each smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hullo, Wallypug!” exclaimed the Pelican.
“Why, we thought you were at Wei-hai-wei.”</p>

<p>“Wer-har-wei, you mean,” laughed his Majesty.</p>

<p>“It’s all the same,” announced the Pelican.
“Well, how have you been getting on?”</p>

<p>His Majesty explained as briefly as possible the
adventures we had passed through, and then inquired
how affairs were progressing at Why.</p>

<p>“Oh, not very well, I’m afraid,” said the Pelican.
“You see, there has been no one to take
the lead since you’ve been away. We tried a
Republican form of government, and elected Oom-Hi
as president, but he became so extravagant&mdash;wanted
a new top-hat every day, and insisted on
a gilded coach to ride in; and at last we caught
him tampering with the public funds, so we had
to dismiss him. Have you heard about Broncho?”</p>

<p>“No,” said his Majesty.</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t answer as a cough mixture, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Oom-Hi turned it into a patent meat extract, and
called it Vimbril, and it killed ever so many
people.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed the Wallypug, anxiously.
“Any one I know?”</p>

<p>“Madame and a few other folk,” was the reply;
“and the Doctor-in-Law is not expected to recover.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! Why, we thought them at
the other end of the world. However did they
get back to Why again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they sent us a cablegram when they got
to China, and we let down an enormously long
rope and pulled them up the shute again, you
know. But it was a very long journey, and they
had nothing to eat on the way. So as soon as we
hauled them up we gave them each a large dose
of Vimbril. Madame expired at once,” he added,
with a sob.</p>

<p>The tears were streaming down the Turtle’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
nose as he sympathetically joined in the Pelican’s
weeping.</p>

<p>“What about the Doctor-in-Law?” inquired
his Majesty, solicitously.</p>

<p>“Oh, he has a very strong constitution, you
know, and he may pull through. We’ve got him
back at the palace in his old quarters.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow! Poor fellow!” said the Wallypug,
sympathetically. “Let’s go and see what
we can do for him.”</p>

<p>I thought this very kind of his Majesty, considering
all he had suffered through the Doctor-in-Law’s
ingratitude; but the good-hearted little
fellow was full of sympathy, and hurried towards
the palace with all speed.</p>

<p class="pch">A NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">“Oh</span> my! Good gracious me!” exclaimed a
voice as we approached the entrance to the palace
and looking up we beheld the Cockatoo perched
on a window-sill. “Just look at these creatures.
<i>What</i> a color. Why, why,” she exclaimed,
peering at us closely, “I’m bothered if it isn’t the
Wallypug and the Hatless Man, and the great
Mr. A. Fish, Esq. Where have you been? What
did you come back for? What do you want?”
she screamed.</p>

<p>“It’s dud of your busidess,” replied A. Fish,
Esq., shortly.</p>

<p>“Oh! isn’t it,” said the Cockatoo furiously.
“I’ll soon show you whether it’s none of my business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
or not. To begin with, the Wallypug and
the headless traitor”&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do you mean me?” I interrupted, “because
I am not headless yet, you know.”</p>

     <p class="pc reduct">“WHAT A COLOR!” EXCLAIMED THE COCKATOO.</p>
</div>

<p>“Headless, or hatless, it’s all the same,” said
the Cockatoo, “you might as well run about without
your head for all the good it is to you,” she
added insolently. “Well you two are escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
prisoners,” she ran on, “and I shall see that you
are locked up again, so there.”</p>

<p>“But it was all a mistake,” said His Majesty
mildly.</p>

<p>“What was?” yelled the bird.</p>

<p>“What I said about a ’horse a horse, my
kingdom for a horse!’ you know,” said the
Wallypug.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say what you mean then?”
cried the Cockatoo. “Well, I shall have you
locked up anyhow. Here, Crocodile,” she shouted,
“just come and arrest these creatures will you?”</p>

<p>“Shan’t!” replied a voice from within; “who
are you ordering about. If you want them arrested,
do it yourself. I’m not going to do as
<i>you</i> tell me, so there! besides, all the prisoners
have been set free that Madame sentenced, you
know that well enough?”</p>

<p>“Yah! Down with him, down with Crocodiles;
down with pale-blue Wallypugs and hatless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
men; down with fishes of all sorts. Down with
everybody and everything; down with&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>We did not stop to hear any more of her ravings,
but passed through and up into the Doctor-in-Law’s
old rooms.</p>

<p>We found him looking very weak and ill, but
he recognized us all, and held out his hand to the
Wallypug, who told him encouragingly that he
would soon be well again.</p>

<p>“Yes, ad thed I’ll teach you elocutiod for
dothig,” promised A. Fish, Esq.</p>

<p>The Doctor-in-Law smiled faintly, and whispered
that what was keeping him back most was
the thought of the heavy doctor’s bill which he
would have to pay when he got better.</p>

<p>The good-natured little Wallypug made him
very happy by promising to pay this amount
for him, and we left the little man looking very
much brighter than when we entered.</p>

<p>The rest of the morning was spent in his
Majesty’s private apartments, discussing all sorts
of plans for the future, for, as the Wallypug very
properly remarked, now that the Mother-in-Law
had gone he should have a freer hand in the administration
of affairs.</p>

<p>A. Fish, Esq., busied himself in preparing an
elaborate lecture, which he said he would deliver
in public on the morrow, on the “Unreasonableness
of Misunderstandability,” and which would,
he hoped, clearly explain away the mistake which
had been made, in accusing his Majesty of treason,
in connection with his unfortunate recitation of
“A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!”</p>

<p>While we were thus busily engaged there came
an impatient tap-tap-tapping at the door, and on
opening it we beheld the Crow looking more disreputably
untidy than ever. He carried a large
bundle of papers and a quill pen. “Ahem!” he
began importantly, “I call on behalf of the <i>Daily
Whyer</i> a new paper which I have just established,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and which I am happy to say has already an
enormous circulation in Why. It is very cheap
(four copies for a penny), and contains an enormous
amount of totally unreliable information;
besides which there is a page devoted to domestic
matters, highly interesting to ladies, and includes
receipts for artistically furnishing your house with
old tea chests and soap boxes, painted with enamel
and draped with art muslin; there are also several
poems weekly on the subject of ‘Baby’s Little
Socks,’ which are immensely popular with some
people, here is one of them,” he cried, turning to
the back page of his paper, a copy of which he had
with him.</p>

<p class="pp7q p1">“Oh! the baby’s little socks,<br />
Darling baby’s little socks;</p>
<p class="pp6">When the kettle’s softly steaming,<br />

Tittle tongues&mdash;but there&mdash;no matter,</p>
<p class="pp7">Let’s get back to baby’s socks.”</p>

<p class="p1">“There,” he concluded triumphantly, “what
do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t wish to be rude,” I remarked,
“but I certainly think it’s the greatest rubbish
I’ve ever heard in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish!” he exclaimed, “Why all the
ladies who read the <i>Daily Whyer</i> think it
<i>beautiful</i>. I have to get the same gentleman to
write verses like that nearly every day.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me,” I replied, “that a
man writes such twaddle as that.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re jealous, that’s what’s the matter
with you. A man write them? of course he
does.”</p>

<p>“And do you pay him for these precious contributions,”
I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>“I <i>promise</i> to pay him ever so much a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>”
said the Crow, “but&mdash;er&mdash;ahem&mdash;I have a very
bad memory. I have several contributors whom
I pay on the same system, it’s a very <i>cheap</i> way,”
he sniffled. “I’ve copied it from a contemporary.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re very busy just dow,” said A.
Fish, Esq., “would you bind telling us your
busidess ad goig, because we wandt to ged to
work agaid.”</p>

<p>“Oh! to tell you the truth,” said the Crow,
“I wanted to know if the Wallypug would let
me print an interview with him in to-morrow’s
paper. You have just returned from Wer-har-wei,
I believe, haven’t you; I was sitting on the
signal post at the station just now and saw you
arrive. I think my readers would be very interested
in hearing your impressions of the country.”</p>

<p>I took his Majesty aside and pointed out to him
that very possibly an interview with him appearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in the paper would have a good effect on his
people, and he could use it as a means of advertising
the reforms he intended making in the government
of the land; and his Majesty agreeing
with me on the point, he seated himself comfortably
in his own particular chair, and the Crow,
perching on the back of another, the interview
began.</p>

<p>“Let’s see,” said the Crow, making a great
spluttering with his pen, which was cross-nibbed
and broken. “When were you born?”</p>

<p>“Well, really,” said his Majesty, “I, er&mdash;was
so young at the time that I scarcely remember.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ll put it down as <span class="smcap">Y. D.</span> 987; that
will do as well as any other date.”</p>

<p>“Why <span class="smcap">Y. D.</span>?” I inquired, curiously.</p>

<p>“Year of disgrace,” was the prompt reply.
“Bless me! this must be a Post Office pen,” he
went on, as the pen scattered the ink about in all
directions. “They are always bad, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>”
Then, having asked the Wallypug no end of
questions, not only about our journey, but on all
sorts of private matters also, the wretched-looking
bird gathered up his papers, which were covered
with unintelligible blots and scratches and
scattered in all parts of the room, and, tucking
them under his wing, departed, to have the matter
set up in print.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Crow had scarcely left the room when
there was another knock, and without waiting for
a reply the Cockatoo burst into the room in a fine
fluster. She was followed by the Kangaroo and
Oom Hi.</p>

<p>“Look at them! <i>Look at them!</i>” she blurted
out, “did you ever see such objects in all your
life. What a color!”</p>

<p>“Hm! Eggshell blue,” said the Kangaroo,
examining the Wallypug critically. “Very
extraordinary tint. Never seen a face that shade
before.”</p>

<p>“The other one is worse,” declared the Cockatoo,
pointing at me derisively. “I always knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
he was something disreputable. I believe,” she
added, sinking her voice into a hoarse whisper,
“I believe he has let himself out as an advertisement
for Stephen’s Blue-black Ink, or Ricket’s
Paris Blue. What depravity. Down with
him! Duck him in the pond! Scrub him
with sandpaper! Boil him!” and so she went
on.</p>

<p>“What’s all this bother about?” I exclaimed.
“Don’t you see that his Majesty is engaged. If
you don’t immediately go about your business I
will have you put out of the room.”</p>

<p>“Oh! will you indeed,” exclaimed the Cockatoo
excitedly, “I should like to see you attempt it.
It strikes me that <i>you</i> are the one that will be put
out. We can stand a good deal down here, but a
hatless object with a <i>blue</i> face. Ough!”</p>

<p>“Here, come and do your duty,” she shouted,
going to the door, and the two Crocodiles entered
and caught hold of me roughly by the collar.
“Bring them out into the courtyard,” shouted
the infuriated bird, and before I could protest I
was bundled unceremoniously out of the house by
the Crocodiles, the Kangaroo and Oom Hi following
with the Wallypug.</p>

off.”&mdash;

<p>“Now then,” said the Cockatoo, stopping before
a large tub of water which stood on the
ground, “see what soap and water will do.”</p>

<p>The Kangaroo rummaged about and discovered
a small hard piece of yellow soap, and Oom Hi
brought forth a good sized sponge, and together
they gave the poor little Wallypug such a scrubbing
as I should think he had never had before in
all his life.</p>

<p>“Ough! ough!” spluttered his Majesty.
“You’re putting it all in my eyes. Oh, ach!
do-o-on’t! Stop! I say, <i>do</i> leave off. Ough!”</p>

<p>The poor little fellow was nearly choked.</p>

<p>Oom Hi sponged the soap away and the Cockatoo
stared critically at the poor Wallypug, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
stood there with the water streaming from his face
and the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t done the slightest good,” she declared;
“better scrape him with a putty knife, I think.”</p>

<p>“Stop a minute!” said the Kangaroo, “I have
it,” and he went up and whispered something in
Oom Hi’s ear.</p>

<p>“Capital! capital! go and fetch a bottle,”
cried Oom Hi, and the Kangaroo rushed off, returning
a minute later with a large bottle marked
Vimbril.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t! don’t!” cried the poor Wallypug.
“I’m not going to take any of that stuff. It
killed the lady who called herself my Sister-in-Law
you know, and it made the Doctor-in-Law ill.
Take it away.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are not going to take any,
Wallypug,” said Oom Hi soothingly, “but there
will be no harm in trying the effect upon your
complexion. It <i>might</i> make you the proper color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
again you know, and in that case I could alter the
name and call it ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’ and advertise
it well; no doubt it would be a great success.
Put some on the sponge,” he continued, holding
it out to the Kangaroo, who poured out some
of the nasty looking stuff.</p>

<p>“No! no! don’t. Ough!” shuddered his Majesty,
but despite his protests his face was well
rubbed with the fluid.</p>

<p>“Worse than ever, he’s light brown now,” said
the Cockatoo.</p>

<p>“Oh! wipe it off! wipe it off,” implored the
Wallypug.</p>

<p>“No!” said Oom Hi, who seemed very greatly
disappointed at the non-success of his experiment,
“let it dry on.”</p>

<p>“We had better put him in the stocks,” he
declared, “to prevent him from rubbing it off.”
So the poor little Wallypug was led off to the
stocks and securely fastened in, with his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
spread out to dry, and with strict injunctions not
to move till he was told.</p>

<p>The last view that I had of his Majesty was of
the poor little fellow, utterly worn out with his
exertions, meekly sitting in the stocks and falling
into an uneasy slumber, from which, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was frequently awakened by the bees and flies,
which, attracted by the sticky stuff on his face
and hands, flocked around him as though he were
a pot of jam.</p>

<p>“We might keep <i>this</i> as a curiosity,” said the
Cockatoo, turning her attention to me next.
“Put in a cage with a large label, ‘Blue-faced
and hatless man, Dangerous!’ he ought to be an
attraction to our menagerie. I think that’s what
we’ll do with him,” and despite my struggles and
protests I was ignominiously marched off by the
Crocodiles, who continued to make rude and personal
remarks about my appearance all the way
to the dungeon, where it appeared I was to
spend my time till a cage could be prepared for
me.</p>

<p>Of course I was terribly indignant at my treatment,
but was absolutely powerless to prevent it
And the only thing that I could do when the
Crocodiles had left me alone, after a few parting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
jeers, was to consider the best way of effecting
my escape.</p>

<p>I was pondering seriously upon this question,
when suddenly I remembered the Gombobble
with which the little blue people had presented
me when I left Wer-har-wei. Taking it from
my pocket I idly wondered if it were good to eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
or not. It felt soft and looked something like a
huge blue orange or a melon; getting out my
penknife I plunged it in and cut the fruit open.
Inside was a white juicy pulp which looked very
tempting, so trusting to its being good to eat I
took a bite.</p>

<p>It was delicious!</p>

<p>I took another bite, and then, happening to
look at my hands, I discovered to my great
delight that they were regaining their proper
color.</p>

<p>“Come, this is better,” I cried, tackling a
third piece; and then suddenly remembering the
poor Wallypug, I carefully cut the Gombobble in
half and put part of it aside for his Majesty, and
was just about to eat another little piece myself,
when, happening to look up, I caught sight
of Mr. Nobody from Nowhere, squeezing through
the bars of my dungeon window.</p>

<p>He was as smiling and happy as ever, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
made me an elaborate bow with an elegant
flourish, and then looked so very knowing that
I felt sure that he had something important to
communicate.</p>

<p>The little fellow bowed and smiled and brought
forth a scrap of paper and a pencil.</p>

<p>On the paper he wrote, “Quite well thanks,
how are you?” and added the words, “Can I be
of any service to you?”</p>

<p>I pondered a moment, and then recollected
that he would be a capital medium of communication
between the Wallypug and myself.</p>

<p>“Do you know where the stocks are?” I
inquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Nobody nodded vigorously.</p>

<p>“His Majesty the Wallypug is there,” I ventured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Nobody nodded again very energetically,
and I could see that he knew all about it. Moreover
he wrote on his paper, “Poor Wallypug!”
and looked most sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Would you like to help him?” I inquired.</p>

<p>The little man nodded again, and seemed quite
delighted at the prospect.</p>

<p>Handing him the half of the Gombobble which
I had reserved for his Majesty, I said, “Take
this to the Wallypug immediately and, <i>if he is
quite alone</i>, tell him to eat it all, and on no
account to tell any one how he became possessed
of it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nobody nodded to show that he understood,
and, taking the piece of Gombobble, he
squeezed through the bars of my cell, and was
soon running off in the direction of the stocks.</p>

<p>I awaited his return with some anxiety, and
was delighted to see when he did come back, that
his face was beaming with delight.</p>

<p>“His Majesty has regained his complexion, and
is very grateful to you,” he wrote hurriedly,
clapping his hands and capering about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now go and tell Oom Hi and the Kangaroo,
and if they come to the conclusion that his
Majesty’s complexion has been restored through
using the stuff they call ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’
don’t say anything to the contrary; it will put
them into a good temper and perhaps make them
kinder to his Majesty.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nobody seemed quite to understand and
hurried off again. He did not come back, but
about half an hour afterwards there was a noise
at the door of my cell, and after a great deal of
fumbling at the lock, Oom Hi and the Kangaroo
entered.</p>

<p>Oom Hi carried a basin and the Kangaroo a
bottle of Vimbril, or Wallypug’s Blush, as it was
now called.</p>

<p>They looked very amiable, and after some
kind remarks about the weather Oom Hi cleared
his throat and said in a sort of apologetic
voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

     <p class="pc reduct">OOM HI CARRIED A BASIN, AND THE KANGAROO A BOTTLE OF VIMBRIL.</p>
</div>

<p>“Er, we didn’t mean to be <i>too</i> severe, you
know, and what we have done has been all for
the best. You will be pleased to hear that my
invaluable preparation, ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’ has
proved perfectly satisfactory, and his Majesty the
Wallypug is a living testimony to its worth. His
beautiful complexion has entirely returned, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
have no doubt if we could persuade you to use
it too it would be equally successful in your
case. You will try it, won’t you?” he pleaded
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Of course if my complexion, such as it is, is
restored, I shall be released from here?” I hazarded.</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly,” said both animals at once,
and so after surreptitiously devouring the remainder
of the Gombobble, I permitted the
creatures to smear my face over with their
precious rubbish on the distinct understanding
that I should be allowed to have a good wash
afterwards.</p>

<p>The Gombobble acted perfectly, and the animals
were delighted when they saw the result, as they
of course put it down to the effect of their “Wallypug’s
Blush.”</p>

<p>“Go and fetch the Cockatoo,” said Oom Hi,
“she shall judge for herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>So the Kangaroo went off to fetch her.</p>

<p>“Wonderful preparation, isn’t it?” said Oom
Hi, gazing affectionately at his bottle of “Wallypug’s
Blush.”</p>

<p>“Very!” I remarked.</p>

<p>“I <i>knew</i> it must be good for something or another,”
he went on, “but of course we could not
tell exactly what till we had tried. It <i>very nearly</i>
cured a cold once, you know, when I called it
Broncho, though I am bound to admit that it was
not exactly a success as Vimbril. Do you think
‘Wallypug’s Blush’ a good title,” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“It’s a very striking one,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“I shall advertise it well in the <i>Daily Whyer</i>,
you know, and&mdash;Oh! here comes the Cockatoo,”
he added, as that bird came bustling into the
cell.</p>

<p>“Now then, what’s this I hear?” she began,
giving me a keen glance; “‘Wallypug’s Blush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>’
restored your complexion. Why so it has, though
I cannot say much for it even now. However,
since you have no longer a blue face you are
scarcely likely to be valuable as a curiosity, so
you had better get about your business,” and,
flinging open the door, the Cockatoo motioned
me out with her crutched stick.</p>

<p>You may be sure I was not long in availing
myself of my liberty and hurrying to the spot
where I had last seen his Majesty.</p>

<p>The stocks were empty, but a little further off
I found A. Fish, Esq., who seemed delighted to
see me.</p>

<p>“Well I dever!” he exclaimed; “I heard you
were going to be exhibited as a freak. What
stories people do tell, to be sure.”</p>

<p>I briefly explained what had happened and
inquired if he knew where the Wallypug
was.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he’s gode back to the Palace,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
A. Fish, Esq. “He’s id a rare way aboudt
you.”</p>

<p>So I thought it best, in order to relieve his
Majesty’s anxiety, to seek him there.</p>

<p>It was now getting dusk, and seeing a light
in his Majesty’s private apartments, I went up
and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” cried a voice which I had no difficulty
in recognizing, and on opening the door I
found the good little man pacing to and fro in a
state of great agitation.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s you,” he exclaimed in a relieved
voice, and came forward to welcome me eagerly.
“I was just wondering how on earth I could
get you out of the Cockatoo’s clutches; she’s a
wretched creature, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Well she is a trial, certainly,” I agreed, “and
I think if I were you I should adopt some very
strong measures for preventing her from interfering
as she does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hm! yes,” said his Majesty, “let’s go and
hear what the Doctor-in-Law has to say about it;
he may be able to advise us as to the best way of
putting her down, and though he will probably
charge pretty stiffly for it, his advice <i>is</i> worth
having sometimes.”</p>

<p>So we went together to the Doctor-in-Law’s
room.</p>

<p>We were surprised to hear several voices talking
excitedly within, and when in reply to a rather
impatient “Come in!” we opened the door, we
were astonished to see the Doctor-in-Law in his
dressing-gown and slippers, in busy consultation
with Oom Hi, the Kangaroo, and the Cockatoo.</p>

<p>“I’ve been greatly interested in hearing of the
success of ‘Wallypug’s Blush,’” said the little
man, “and am just helping Oom Hi (ahem, for a
consideration) to draw up a prospectus for turning
it into a Limited Company. In consideration of
the payment to me of several thousands of pounds,
I am about to become a director, and am to be
paid several thousands more for persuading the
Cockatoo to join the board too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“But,” I objected, “what do you claim that
‘Wallypug’s Blush’ does?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it restores people with blue complexions
to their natural color, you know.”</p>

<p>“But surely there will be a very limited sale,”
I said; “there cannot be very many people with
blue faces, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>of course</i>, you must try and spoil everything
with your absurd objections,” said the
Cockatoo crossly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I really don’t see that your contention
has much weight,” said the Doctor-in-Law.
“Provided it is only advertised enough, the
public will buy <i>any</i> rubbish, whether it does what
it professes to do or not. And we shall simply
call it ‘Wallypug’s Blush <i>for the complexion</i>,’
you know; besides, even if it doesn’t answer, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
can turn it into something else, Boot Polish or
Hair Wash, you know.”</p>

<p>And so seeing them so busily and enthusiastically
engaged in the business of drawing up the
prospectus, we said good-night and retired to our
rooms.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">“AU REVOIR.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning all was excitement at the
palace. The news of our return had spread abroad,
and in the morning copy of the <i>Daily Whyer</i>,
which his Majesty found on the breakfast-table
when we went down, a full and, I must say, surprisingly
accurate account of the interview appeared,
together with the information that his
Majesty would attend Parliament in state in the
afternoon, and that an address from the throne
would be read, in which certain changes in the
Government would be suggested. There was
also a paragraph about A. Fish, Esquire’s, lecture
upon the “Unreasonableness of ability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>”
which the editor advised everybody to
try and hear.</p>

<p>His Majesty was in quite a fluster, and we spent
several hours in preparing an elaborate written
speech which he was to read out in the afternoon;
and then, having settled this and other matters
to our satisfaction, we took Kis-Smee out for a
little walk just before luncheon.</p>

<p>One of the first persons we met was the Crocodile
at the Lodge. He looked once or twice at
his Majesty, as if in doubt, and then at Kis-Smee.</p>

<p>On seeing the latter his eyes sparkled, and he
came up and spoke at once.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Wallypug!” he began unceremoniously.</p>

<p>His Majesty bowed, a little distantly I thought.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> a fine fat dog!” exclaimed the Crocodile,
pointing to Kis-Smee. “Is he for sale?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” said the Wallypug.</p>

<p>The Crocodile sighed. “Just my luck,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
remarked, “I love dogs and I should so enjoy
taking this one home to tea with me. Perhaps
you will let him visit me sometimes. What’s his
name?”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-189.jpg" width="300" height="311"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc reduct">“OH! REALLY, WALLYPUG, THIS IS SO SUDDEN.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Kis-Smee,” said his Majesty.</p>

<p>“Oh! really Wallypug, this is so sudden,” said
the Crocodile, smirking, “I’d no idea you were
so affectionate. I’m so bashful, too. I couldn’t
really think of kissing you in public.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no!” explained his Majesty hastily&mdash;“Kis-Smee
is the dog’s name; you asked me what
his name was, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the Crocodile, looking greatly disappointed.
“I misunderstood you. Very sorry,
I’m sure. Well, what are you going to do now?”</p>

<p>His Majesty told him of the meeting in the
afternoon, and the Crocodile promised to come.</p>

<p>“That is,” he added, “if I may bring my invalid
with me.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked the Wallypug.</p>

<p>“Oh! a very feeble old joke I’ve got staying
with me,” said the Crocodile. “I could bring
him in the perambulator, you know&mdash;the one I
used to wheel the weak cup of tea about in&mdash;he’s
such a nice old man.”</p>

<p>“What is he, did you say?” asked his Majesty.</p>

<p>“An old joke,” repeated the Crocodile, “his
name is Joe Miller, and he eats nothing but chestnuts,
and even they have to be very ancient before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
he can digest them. Oh! he’s a character, I
can tell you. Make you die of laughing the <i>first</i>
time you meet him; but as he always says the
same thing over and over again&mdash;for hours and
hours, he is rather trying at times. However, I
will bring him along, and you can judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>We left the Crocodile then and went back to
luncheon&mdash;after which we set out for the House
of Words.</p>

<p>We found that quite a lot of Creatures were
waiting in the lobby for the doors to open.</p>

<p>There was the Doctor-in-Law, telling a funny
story to the Pig, for which he afterwards made a
charge of one pound nineteen and elevenpence,
describing it as <i>Professional Attendance</i>&mdash;and
wording the bill as follows:</p>

<table id="td1" summary="td1">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdl1">To One pig, one guinea (guinea-pig),</td>
  <td class="tdr1">£1</td>
  <td class="tdr1">1</td>
  <td class="tdr1">0</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdl1">“Laugh and grow fat,” one joke,</td>
  <td class="tdr1">0</td>
  <td class="tdr1">6</td>
  <td class="tdr1">8</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td rowspan="2"> </td>
  <td colspan="3" class="tdr1">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdr1">£1</td>
  <td class="tdr1">19</td>
  <td class="tdr1">11</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">And to the Mole, who happened to overhear the
joke, he made another charge; but the Mole got
out of paying for it on the plea that he <i>couldn’t
see it</i>; but whether he meant the bill or the joke
I could never find out, Moles are notoriously
blind.</p>

<p>Oom-Hi was there and the Turtle too, and A.
Fish, Esq., listened, open-mouthed, while they discussed
the state of affairs.</p>

<p>The Cockatoo, irrepressible as ever, held forth
on the subject of Socialism to an interested audience,
consisting of the Crocodile and the Rabbit.
While the Crow filled in a few spare moments by
interviewing the Pelican. The Creatures stood
aside very politely to allow his Majesty and myself
to enter, Kis-Smee growling ominously at the
Cockatoo, who screamed, “Down with domestic
animals,” as he passed. This remark of hers gave
offense to the Pig also, who demanded to know if
she was referring to him.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied the Cockatoo; “you’re
not a domestic animal, are you?”</p>

<p>“Sure an I am that same in me own counthry,”
said the Pig, who was evidently of Irish descent.</p>

<p>“Och down with the dirthy landlords thin,”
screamed the Cockatoo, which caused the Pig to
laugh and put him in a good temper again.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t bring the old joke along after all,”
whispered the Crocodile to me, as we squeezed
through the door; “he is more feeble than ever.”
“How’s Kis-Smee?”</p>

<p>“Quite well, I think, thank you,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he delightfully fat,” whispered the Crocodile,
smacking his lips. “About three nice
large mouthfuls, I should say,” he concluded
mysteriously, winking one eye at me.</p>

<p>I haven’t the remotest idea what he meant, and
besides I hadn’t time to think about it then, for
the meeting was about to commence.</p>

<p>We all found seats, and A. Fish, Esq., being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
called upon to open the proceedings, he commenced
his learned treatise upon the “Unreasonableness
of Misunderstandability.”</p>

<p>What it was all about I haven’t the remotest
idea, for what with his extraordinary way of talking,
and the continual interruptions of the animals,
who would keep shouting, “Hear! hear!”
“Question!” “Withdraw!” “Order! order!”
etc., at all kinds of odd moments, I could not hear
a word that was being said. Moreover, the hall
was unaccountably hot and stuffy, and for some
time I had the greatest difficulty in keeping
awake; and at last my head sank down and I
dozed off, awaking at intervals when the Cockatoo
was unusually energetic; but at last even her
voice was silenced, and I remember no more till I
awoke with a start, and found myself, to my
great dismay, back again in my own study in
London.</p>

<p>I have addressed several letters to “His Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the Wallypug, The Royal Palace, Why,” as
I am very anxious to know how affairs are going
on there; but I am sorry to say they have always
been returned through the post, marked in blue
pencil, “<i>Not known. Insufficient address.</i>”</p>

<p class="pch">AN ADVENTURE IN THURINGEN.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And then on the top of the Caldon Low<br />
There was no one left but me.”</p>
<p class="pr8 reduct"><span class="smcap">Mary Howitt.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">“I liked</span> the blue dwarfs the best&mdash;far, far the
best of anything,” said Olive.</p>

<p>“‘The blue dwarfs!’” repeated Rex. “What
<i>do</i> you mean? Why can’t you say what you
mean plainly? Girls have such a stupid way of
talking!”</p>

<p>“What can be plainer than <i>the blue dwarfs</i>?”
said Olive rather snappishly, though, it must be
allowed, with some reason. “We were talking
about the things we liked best at the china place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
<i>You</i> said the stags’ heads and the inkstands, and
<i>I</i> say the blue dwarfs.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t see any dwarfs,” persisted Rex.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it if you didn’t. You had
just as much chance of seeing them as I had.
They were in a corner by themselves&mdash;little figures
about two inches high, all with blue coats on.
There were about twelve of them, all different,
but all little dwarfs or gnomes. One was sitting
on a barrel, one was turning head-over-heels, one
was cuddling his knees&mdash;all funny ways like that.
Oh, they were lovely!”</p>

<p>“I wish I had seen them better,” said Rex regretfully.
“I do remember seeing a tray full of
little blue-looking dolls, but I didn’t notice what
they were.”</p>

<p>Olive did not at once answer. Her eyes were
fixed on something she saw passing before the
window. It was a very, very little man. He
was not exactly humpbacked, but his figure was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
somewhat deformed, and he was so small that
but for the sight of his rather wizened old face
one could hardly have believed he was a full-grown
man. His eyes were bright and beady-looking,
like those of a good-natured little weasel,
if there be such a thing, and his face lighted up
with a smile as he caught sight of the two, to
him, strange-looking children at the open window
of the little village inn.</p>

<p>“Guten Tag,” he said, nodding to them; and
“Guten Tag,” replied the children, as they had
learnt to do by this time to everybody they met.
For in these remote villages it would be thought
the greatest breach of courtesy to pass any one
without this friendly greeting.</p>

<p>Rex drew a long breath when the dwarf had
passed.</p>

<p>“Olive&mdash;&mdash;” he began, but Olive interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“Rex,” she said eagerly, “that’s <i>exactly</i> like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
them&mdash;like the blue dwarfs, I mean. Only, of
course, their faces were prettier&mdash;nice little china
faces, rather crumply looking, but quite nice;
and then their coats were such a pretty nice blue.
I think,” she went on consideringly&mdash;“I think
if I had that little man and washed his face <i>very</i>
well, and got him a bright blue coat, he would
look just like one of the blue dwarfs grown
big.”</p>

<p>Rex looked at Olive with a queer expression.</p>

<p>“Olive,” he said in rather an awe-struck tone;
“Olive, do you think perhaps they’re <i>real</i>? Do
you think perhaps somewhere in this country&mdash;in
those queer dark woods, perhaps&mdash;that there
are real blue dwarfs, and that somebody must
have seen them and made the little china ones
like them? Perhaps,” and his voice dropped
and grew still more solemn; “<i>perhaps</i>, Olive,
that little man’s one of them, and they may have
to take off their blue coats when they’re walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
about. Do you know, I think it’s a little, just a
very little frightening? Don’t you, Olive?”</p>

<p>“No, of course I don’t,” said Olive, and, to do
her justice, her rather sharp answer was meant
as much to reassure her little brother as to express
any feeling of impatience. Rex was quite
a little fellow, only eight, and Olive, who was
nearly twelve, remembered that when she was
as little as that, she used sometimes to feel frightened
about things which she now couldn’t see
anything the least frightening in. And she remembered
how once or twice some of her big
cousins had laughed at her, and amused themselves
by telling her all sorts of nonsense, which
still seemed terrible to her when she was alone
in her room in the dark at night. “Of course
there’s nothing frightening in it,” she said. “It
would be rather a funny idea, I think. Of course
it can’t be, you know, Rex. There are no dwarfs,
and gnomes, and fairies now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“But that little man was a dwarf,” said Rex.</p>

<p>“Yes, but a dwarf needn’t be a fairy sort of
person,” explained Olive. “He’s just a common
little man, only he’s never grown as big as
other people. Perhaps he had a bad fall when
he was a baby&mdash;that might stop his growing.”</p>

<p>“Would it?” said Rex. “I didn’t know that.
I hope I hadn’t a bad fall when I was a baby.
Everybody says I’m very small for my age.”
And Rex looked with concern at his short but
sturdy legs.</p>

<p>Olive laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Oh, Rex, what a funny boy you are! No,
certainly, you are not a dwarf. You’re as
straight and strong as you can be.”</p>

<p>“Well, but,” said Rex, returning to the first
subject, “I do think it’s very queer about that
little dwarf man coming up the street just as
you were telling me about the blue dwarfs. And
he <i>did</i> look at us in a funny way, Olive, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
you say, just as if he had heard what we
were talking about.”</p>

<p>“All the people look at us in a funny way
here,” said Olive. “We must look very queer to
them. Your sailor suit, Rex, and my ‘Bolero’
hat must look to them quite as queer as the
women’s purple skirts, with bright green aprons,
look to us.”</p>

<p>“Or the bullock-carts,” said Rex. “Do you
remember how queer we thought them at first?
<i>Now</i> we’ve got quite used to seeing queer things,
haven’t we, Olive? Oh! now do look there&mdash;at
the top of the street&mdash;there, Olive, did you ever
see such a load as that woman is carrying in the
basket on her back? Why, it’s as big as a house!”</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten about the dwarfs,
and Olive was rather glad of it. These two children
were traveling with their uncle and aunt
in a rather out-of-the-way part of Germany.
Out-of-the-way, that is to say, to most of the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
summer tourists from other countries,
who prefer going where they are more sure of
finding the comforts and luxuries they are accustomed
to at home. But it was by no means
out-of-the-way in the sense of being dull or
deserted. It is a very busy part of the world
indeed. You would be amazed if I were to tell
you some of the beautiful things that are made
in these bare homely little German cottages. For
all about in the neighborhood there are great
manufactories and warehouses for china and
glass, and many other things; and some parts
of the work are done by the people at home
in their own houses. The morning of the day
of which I am telling you had been spent by the
children and their friends in visiting a very large
china manufactory, and their heads were full of
the pretty and wonderful things they had seen.</p>

<p>And now they were waiting in the best parlor
of the village inn while their uncle arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
about a carriage to take them all on to the small
town where they were to stay a few days. Their
aunt was tired, and was resting a little on the
sofa, and they had planted themselves on the
broad window-sill, and were looking out with
amusement at all that passed.</p>

<p>“What have you been chattering about all
this time?” said their aunt, suddenly looking
up. “I think I must have been asleep a little,
but I have heard your voices going on like two
birds twittering.”</p>

<p>“Have we disturbed you, Auntie?” asked
Olive, with concern.</p>

<p>“Oh no, not a bit; but come here and tell me
what you have been talking about.”</p>

<p>Instantly Rex’s mind went back to the dwarfs.</p>

<p>“Auntie,” he said seriously, “perhaps you can
tell me better than Olive can. Are there really
countries of dwarfs, and are they a kind of
fairies, Auntie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Auntie looked rather puzzled.</p>

<p>“Dwarfs, Rex?” she said; “countries of
dwarfs! How do you mean?”</p>

<p>Olive hastened to explain. Auntie was very
much amused.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she said, “we have already seen
so many strange things in our travels that it is
better not to be too sure what we may not see.
But any way, Rex, you may be quite easy in your
mind, that if ever you come across any of the
dwarfs, you will find them very good-natured
and amiable, only you must be very respectful&mdash;always
say ‘Sir,’ or ‘My lord,’ or something
like that to them, and bow a great deal. And
you must never seem to think anything they do
the least odd, not even if they propose to you to
walk on your head, or to eat roast fir-cones for
dinner, for instance.”</p>

<p>Auntie was quite young&mdash;not so very much
older than Olive&mdash;and very merry. Olive’s rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
“grown-up” tones and manners used sometimes
to tempt her to make fun of the little girl, which,
to tell the truth, Olive did not always take quite
in good part. And it must for Olive be allowed,
that Auntie did sometimes allow her spirits and
love of fun to run away with her a little too far,
just like pretty unruly ponies, excited by the
fresh air and sunshine, who toss their heads and
gallop off. It is great fun at first and very nice
to see, but one is sometimes afraid they may do
some mischief on the way&mdash;without meaning it,
of course; and, besides, it is not always so easy
to pull them up as it was to start them.</p>

<p>Just as Auntie finished speaking the door
opened and their uncle came in. He was Auntie’s
elder brother&mdash;a good deal older&mdash;and very kind
and sensible. At once all thoughts of the dwarfs
or what Auntie had been saying danced out of
Rex’s curly head. Like a true boy he flew off to
his uncle, besieging him with questions as to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
sort of a carriage they were to go on in&mdash;<i>was</i> it
an ox-cart; oh, mightn’t they <i>for once</i> go in an
ox-cart? and might he&mdash;oh, might he sit beside
the driver in front?</p>

<p>His uncle laughed and replied to his questions,
but Olive stayed beside the sofa, staring gravely
at her aunt.</p>

<p>“Auntie,” she said, “you’re not <i>in earnest</i>,
are you, about there being really a country of
dwarfs?”</p>

<p>Olive was twelve. Perhaps you will think her
very silly to have imagined for a moment that her
aunt’s joke could be anything but a joke, especially
as she had been so sensible about not letting
Rex get anything into his head which could
frighten him. But I am not sure that she was
so very silly after all. She had read in her geography
about the Lapps and Finns, the tiny little
men of the north, whom one might very well
describe as dwarfs; there might be dwarfs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
these strange Thüringian forests, which were
little spoken of in geography books; Auntie
knew more of such things than she did, for she
had traveled in this country before. Then with
her own eyes Olive had seen a dwarf, and though
she had said to Rex that he was just an odd dwarf
by himself as it were, not one of a race, how could
she tell but what he might be one of a number
of such queer little people? And even the blue
dwarfs themselves&mdash;the little figures in the china
manufactory&mdash;rather went to prove it than not.</p>

<p>“They may have taken the idea of dwarfs
from the real ones, as Rex said,” thought Olive.
“Any way I shall look well about me if we go
through any of these forests again. They must
live in the forests, for Auntie said they eat roast
fir-cones for dinner.”</p>

<p>All these thoughts were crowding through her
mind as she stared up into Auntie’s face and
asked solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Auntie, were you in earnest?”</p>

<p>Auntie’s blue eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“In earnest, Olive?” she said. “Of course!
Why shouldn’t I be in earnest? But come, quick,
we must get our things together. Your uncle
must have got a carriage.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “I have. <i>Not</i> an ox-cart, Rex.
I’m sorry for your sake, but for no one else’s;
for I don’t think there would be much left of us
by the end of the journey if we were to be jogged
along the forest roads in an ox-cart. No! I
have got quite a respectable vehicle; but we
must stop an hour or two on the way, to rest the
horses and give them a feed, otherwise we could
not get through to-night.”</p>

<p>“Where shall we stop?” said Auntie, as with
the bundles of shawls and bags they followed the
children’s uncle to the door.</p>

<p>“There is a little place in the forest, where
they can look after the horses,” said he; “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I daresay we can get some coffee there for ourselves,
if we want it. It is a pretty little nook.
I remember it long ago, and I shall be glad to
see it again.”</p>

<p>Olive had pricked up her ears. “A little place
in the forest!” she said to herself; “that may
be near where the dwarfs live: it is most likely
not far from here, because of the one we saw.”
She would have liked to ask her uncle about it,
but something in the look of her aunt’s eyes kept
her from doing so.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she <i>was</i> joking,” thought Olive to
herself. “But perhaps she doesn’t know; <i>she</i>
didn’t see the real dwarf. It would be rather
nice if I did find them, <i>then</i> Auntie couldn’t
laugh at me any more.”</p>

<p>They were soon comfortably settled in the carriage,
and set off. The first part of the drive
was not particularly interesting; and it was so
hot, though already afternoon, that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
all&mdash;Olive especially, you may be sure&mdash;delighted
to exchange the open country for the pleasant
shade of a grand pine forest, through which their
road now lay.</p>

<p>“Is it a very large forest, Uncle?” said Olive.</p>

<p>“Yes, very large,” he replied rather sleepily,
to tell the truth: for both he and Auntie had
been nodding a little, and Rex had once or twice
been fairly asleep. But Olive’s imagination was
far too hard at work to let her sleep.</p>

<p>“The largest in Europe?” she went on, without
giving much thought to poor Uncle’s sleepiness.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, by far,” he replied, for he had not
heard clearly what she said, and fancied it was
“the largest hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought Olive, looking round her
with awe and satisfaction. “If there are dwarfs
anywhere, then it must be here.”</p>

<p>And she was just beginning another. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
please, Uncle, is&mdash;&mdash;?” when her aunt looked up
and said lazily&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear child, do be quiet! Can’t you
go to sleep yourself a little! We shall have more
than enough of the forest before we are out of
it?” Which offended Olive so much that she
relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Auntie was a truer prophet than she knew;
for when they got to the little hamlet in the wood,
where they were to rest, something proved to be
wrong with one of the horse’s shoes; <i>so</i> wrong,
indeed, that after a prolonged examination, at
which all the inhabitants turned out to assist, it
was decided that the horse must be re-shod before
he could go any farther; and this made it impossible
for the party who had come in the carriage
to go any farther either. For the nearest smithy
was two miles off; the horse must be led there
and back by the driver, which would take at
least two, if not three, hours. It was now past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
six, and they had come barely half way. The
driver shook his head, and said he would not like
to go on to the town till morning. The horse
had pricked his foot; it might cause inflammation
to drive him farther without a rest, and the
carriage was far too heavy for the other horse
alone, which had suddenly struck the children’s
uncle as a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>“There would be no difficulty about the harnessing,
any way,” he said to Auntie, laughing;
“for all the vehicles hereabouts drawn by one
horse have the animal at one side of a pole, instead
of between shafts.”</p>

<p>But Auntie thought it better to give in.</p>

<p>“It really doesn’t much matter,” she said; “we
can stay here well enough. There are two bedrooms,
and no doubt they can give us something
to eat; beer and sausages, and brown bread any
way.”</p>

<p>And so it was settled greatly to Olive’s satisfaction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
it would give her capital opportunities
for a dwarf hunt! though as to this she kept her
own counsel.</p>

<p>The landlady of the little post-house where they
had stopped was accustomed to occasional visits of
this kind from benighted or distressed travelers.
She thought nothing of turning her two daughters
out of their bedroom, which, it must be
owned, was very clean, for Auntie and Olive,
and a second room on the ground-floor was prepared
for Rex and his uncle. She had coffee ready
in five minutes, and promised them a comfortable
supper before bedtime. Altogether, everything
seemed very satisfactory, and when they
felt a little refreshed, Auntie proposed a walk&mdash;“a
good long walk,” she said, “would do us
good. And the landlady says we get out of the
forest up there behind the house, where the
ground rises, and that there is a lovely view. It
will be rather a climb, but it isn’t more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
three quarters of an hour from here, and we have
not walked all day.”</p>

<p>Uncle thought it a good idea, and Rex was
ready to start at once; but Olive looked less
pleased.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to come, Olive?” said Auntie.
“Are you tired? You didn’t take a nap like the
rest of us.”</p>

<p>“I am a little tired,” said Olive, which was
true in one sense, though not in another, for she
was quite fit for a walk. It struck her that her
excuse was not quite an honest one, so she added,
“If you don’t mind, I would rather stay about
here. I don’t mind being alone, and I have my
book. And I do so like the forest.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said her uncle; “only don’t lose
yourself. She is perfectly safe,” he added, turning
to her aunt; “there are neither wolves, nor
bears, nor robbers nowadays, in these peaceful
forests.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>So the three set off, leaving Olive to her own
devices. She waited till they were out of sight,
then she made her preparations.</p>

<p>“I’d better take my purse,” she said to herself,
“in case I meet the dwarfs. Auntie told
me to be very polite, and perhaps they would like
some of these tiny pieces; they just look as if
they were meant for them.” So she chose out a
few one-pfennig copper coins, which are much
smaller than our farthings, and one or two silver
pieces, worth about twopence-halfpenny each,
still smaller. Then she put in her pocket half a
slice of the brown bread they had had with their
coffee, and arming herself, more for appearance’-sake
than anything else, with her parasol and
the book she had with her in her traveling bag,
she set off on her solitary ramble.</p>

<p>It was still hot&mdash;though the forest trees made a
pleasant shade. Olive walked some way, farther
and farther, as far as she could make out, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
heart of the forest, but in her inexperience she took
no sort of care to notice the way she went, or to
make for herself any kind of landmarks. She
just wandered on and on, tempted first by some
mysterious little path, and then by another, her
mind full of the idea of the discoveries she was
perhaps about to make. Now and then a squirrel
darted across from one tree to another, disappearing
among the branches almost before Olive could
be sure she had seen it, or some wild wood birds,
less familiar to the little foreigner, would startle
her with a shrill, strange note. There were here
and there lovely flowers growing among the
moss, and more than once she heard the sound of
not far off trickling water. It was all strangely
beautiful, and she would greatly have enjoyed and
admired it had not her mind been so full of the
queer fascinating idea of the blue dwarfs.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;she had wandered about for some
time&mdash;Olive began to feel tired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“I may as well sit down a little,” she thought;
“I have lots of time to get back. This seems
the very heart of the forest. They are just as
likely to be seen here as anywhere else.”</p>

<p>So Olive ensconced herself in a comfortable
corner, her back against the root of a tree, which
seemed hollowed out on purpose to serve as an
armchair. She thought at first she would read
a little, but the light was already slightly waning,
and the tree shadows made it still fainter.
Besides, Olive had plenty to think of&mdash;she did
not require any amusement. Queer little noises
now and then made themselves heard&mdash;once or
twice it really sounded as if small feet were pattering
along, or as if shrill little voices were laughing
in the distance; and with each sound, Olive’s
heart beat faster with excitement&mdash;not with
fear.</p>

<p>“If I sit very still,” she thought, “who knows
what I may see? Of course, it would be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
nicer and prettier if the dwarfs were quite tiny&mdash;not
like the little man we saw in the street at that
place&mdash;I forget the name&mdash;for he was not pretty
at all&mdash;but like the blue dwarfs at the manufactory.
But that, I suppose, is impossible, for they
would be really like fairies. But they might be
something between: not so big as the little man,
and yet bigger than the blue dwarfs.”</p>

<p>And then Olive grew a little confused in trying
to settle in her mind how big, or how small rather,
it was possible or impossible for a nation of dwarfs
to be. She thought it over till she hardly seemed
sure what she was trying to decide. She kept
saying to herself, “Any way, they could not but
be a good deal bigger than my thumb! What
does that mean? Perhaps it means more in German
measures than in English, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But what was that that suddenly hit her on the
nose! Olive looked up, a very little inclined to
be offended; it is not a pleasant thing to be hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
on the nose; could it be Rex come behind her
suddenly, and playing her a trick? Just as she
was thinking this, a second smart tap on the nose
startled her still more, and this time there was no
mistake about it; it came from above, and it was
a fir-cone! Had it come of itself? Somehow the
words, “Roast fir-cones for dinner,” kept running
in her head, and she took up the fir-cone in
her fingers to examine it, but quickly dropped it
again, for it was as hot as a coal.</p>

<p>“It has a very roasty smell,” thought Olive;
“where can it have come from?”</p>

<p>And hardly had she asked herself the question,
when a sudden noise all round her made her
again look up. They were sliding down the
branches of the tree in all directions. At first,
to her dazzled eyes, they seemed a whole army,
but as they touched the ground one by one, and
she was able to distinguish them better, she saw
that after all there were not so <i>very</i> many. One,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
two, three, she began quickly counting to herself,
not aloud, of course&mdash;that would not have
been polite&mdash;one, two, three, up to twelve, then
thirteen, fourteen and so on up to&mdash;yes, there
were just twenty-four of them.</p>

<p>“Two of each,” said Olive to herself; “a double
set of the blue dwarfs.”</p>

<p>For they were the blue dwarfs, and no mistake!
Two of each, as Olive had seen at once.
And immediately they settled themselves in twos&mdash;two
squatted on the ground embracing their
knees, two strode across a barrel which they had
somehow or other brought with them, two began
turning head-over-heels, two knelt down with
their heads and queer little grinning faces looking
over their shoulders, twos and twos of them in
every funny position you could imagine, all arranged
on the mossy ground in front of where
Olive sat, and all dressed in the same bright blue
coats as the toy dwarfs at the china manufactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Olive sat still and looked at them. Somehow
she did not feel surprised.</p>

<p>“How big are they?” she said to herself.
“Bigger than my thumb? Oh yes, a good deal.
I should think they are about as tall as my arm
would be if it was standing on the ground. I
should think they would come up above my knee.
I should like to stand up and measure, but perhaps
it is better for me not to speak to them till
they speak to me.”</p>

<p>She had not long to wait. In another moment
two little blue figures separated themselves from
the crowd, and made their way up to her. But
when they were close to her feet they gave a sudden
jump in the air, and came down, not on their
feet, but on their heads! And then again some
of her aunt’s words came back to her, “If they
should ask you to stand on your head, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” thought Olive, “how did Auntie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
know so much about them? But I do hope they
won’t ask me to stand on <i>my</i> head.”</p>

<p>Her fears were somewhat relieved when the
dwarfs gave another spring and came down this
time in a respectable manner on their feet. Then,
with a good many bows and flourishes, they
began a speech.</p>

<p>“We are afraid,” said the first.</p>

<p>“That the fir-cones,” said the second.</p>

<p>“Were rather underdone,” finished up the
first.</p>

<p>Olive really did not know what to say. She
was dreadfully afraid that it would seem so
very rude of her not even to have <i>tasted</i> the
cones. But naturally she had not had the
slightest idea that they had been intended for
her to eat.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” she said, “Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, sir!
my lord! I beg your pardon. I don’t quite
know what I should call you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“With all respect,” said the first.</p>

<p>“And considering the circumstances,” went on
the second.</p>

<p>Then just as Olive supposed they were going
to tell her their names, they stopped short and
looked at her.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” she began again, after
waiting a minute or two to see if they had nothing
else to say; “I don’t quite understand.”</p>

<p>“Nor do we,” they replied promptly, speaking
for the first time both together.</p>

<p>“Do you mean you don’t know what <i>my</i> name
is?” said she. “It’s Olive, <i>Olive</i>” for the
dwarfs stood staring as if they had not heard her.
“<span class="smcap">Olive</span>!” she repeated for the third time.</p>

<p>“Green?” asked the first.</p>

<p>“No!” said Olive. “Of course not! <i>Green</i>
is a very common name&mdash;at least&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But you called us ‘blue,’” said the second;
and it really was a relief to hear him finish a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
sentence comfortably by himself, only Olive felt
very puzzled by what he said.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” she said. “How could
you tell I called you the blue dwarfs?” and then
another thought suddenly struck her. How very
odd it was that the dwarf spoke such good English!
“I thought you were German,” she said.</p>

<p>“How very amusing!” said the dwarfs, this
time again speaking together.</p>

<p>Olive could not see that it was very amusing,
but she was afraid of saying so, for fear it should
be rude.</p>

<p>“And about the fir-cones,” went on the first
dwarf. “It is distressing to think they were so
underdone. But we have come, all of us,” waving
his hand in the direction of the others, “to
invite you to supper in our village. There you
will find them done to perfection.”</p>

<p>Olive felt more and more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” she said. “I should like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to come very much if it isn’t too far; but I am
afraid I couldn’t eat any supper. Indeed, I’m
not hungry.” And then a bright thought struck
her. “See here,” she went on, drawing the half
slice of bread out of her pocket, “I had to put
this in my pocket, for I couldn’t finish it at our
afternoon coffee.”</p>

<p>The two dwarfs came close and examined the
piece of bread with the greatest attention. They
pinched and smelt it, and one of them put out his
queer little pointed tongue and licked it.</p>

<p>“Not good!” he said, looking up at Olive and
rolling about his eyes in a very queer way.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Olive; “I don’t think
it can be bad. It is the regular bread of the
country. I should have thought you would be
accustomed to it, as you live here.”</p>

<p>The two dwarfs took no notice of what she
said, but suddenly turned round, and standing
with their backs to Olive called out shrilly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
“Gueton Tag.” Immediately all the other
dwarfs replied in the same tone and the same
words, and to Olive’s great surprise they all began
to move towards her, but without altering
their attitudes&mdash;those on the barrel rolled towards
her without getting off it; the two who were
hugging their knees continued to hug them,
while they came on by means of jerking themselves;
the turning head-over-heels ones span
along like wheels, and so on till the whole assemblage
were at her feet. Then she saw unfolded
before her, hanging on the branches of
the tree, a large mantle, just the shape of her
aunt’s travelling dust-cloak, which she always
spread over Olive in a carriage, only, instead of
being drab or fawn-colored, it was, like the
dwarfs’ jackets, bright blue. And without any
one telling her, Olive seemed to know of herself
that she was to put it on.</p>

<p>She got up and reached the cloak easily; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
seemed to put itself on, and Olive felt very happy
and triumphant as she said to herself, “Now
I’m really going to have some adventures.”</p>

<p>The dwarfs marched&mdash;no! one cannot call it
marching, for they had about a dozen different
ways of proceeding&mdash;they moved on, and Olive
in the middle, her blue cloak floating majestically
on her shoulders. No one spoke a word.
It grew darker and darker among the trees, but
Olive did not feel frightened. On they went, till
at last she saw twinkling before them a very
small but bright blue light. It looked scarcely
larger than the lamp of a glow-worm, but it
shone out very distinct in the darkness. Immediately
they saw it the dwarfs set up a shout, and
as it died away, to Olive’s surprise, they began
to sing. And what do you think they sang?
Olive at first could hardly believe her ears as
they listened to the thoroughly English song of
“Home, sweet Home.” And the queerest thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
was that they sang it very prettily, and that it
sounded exactly like her aunt’s voice! And
though they were walking close beside her, their
voices when they left off singing did not so much
seem to stop as to move off, to die away into the
distance, which struck Olive as very odd.</p>

<p>They had now arrived at the trunk of a large
tree, half way up which hung the little lamp&mdash;at
least Olive supposed it must be a lamp&mdash;from
which came the bright blue light.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said one of the dwarfs, she did
not see which, “at the entrance to our village.”
And thereupon all the dwarfs began climbing up
the tree, swarming about it like a hive of bees,
till they got some way up, when one after another
they suddenly disappeared. Olive could
see all they did by the blue light. She was beginning
to wonder if she would be left standing
there alone, when a shout made her look up, and
she saw two dwarfs standing on a branch holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a rope ladder, which they had just thrown
down, and making signs to her to mount up by
it. It was quite easy; up went Olive, step by
step, and when she reached the place where the
two dwarfs were standing, she saw how it was
that they had all disappeared. The tree trunk
was hollow, and there were steps cut in it like a
stair, down which the dwarfs signed to her that
she was to go. She did not need to be twice told,
so eager was she to see what was to come. The
stair was rather difficult for her to get down
without falling, for the steps were too small,
being intended for the dwarfs, but Olive managed
pretty well, only slipping now and then. The
stair seemed very long, and as she went farther
it grew darker, till at last it was quite dark; by
which time, fortunately, however, she felt herself
again on level ground, and after waiting half
a minute a door seemed to open, and she found
herself standing outside the tree stair, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
prettiest sight before her eyes that she had ever
seen or even imagined.</p>

<p>It was the dwarf village! Rows and rows of
tiny houses&mdash;none of them more than about twice
as high as Olive herself, for that was quite big
enough for a dwarf cottage, each with a sweet little
garden in front, like what one sees in English
villages, though the houses themselves were like
Swiss châlets. It was not dark down here, there
was a soft light about as bright as we have it
at summer twilight; and besides this each little
house had a twinkling blue light hanging above
the front door, like a sign-post. And at the door
of each cottage stood one of the dwarfs, with a
little dwarf wife beside him; only, instead of
blue, each little woman was dressed in brown,
so that they were rather less showy than their
husbands. They all began bowing as Olive appeared,
and all the little women curtseying, and
Olive seemed to understand, without being told,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that she was to walk up the village street to see
all there was to be seen. So on she marched, her
blue cloak floating about her, so that sometimes
it reached the roofs of the houses on each side at
the same time.</p>

<p>Olive felt herself rather clumsy. Her feet,
which in general she was accustomed to consider
rather neat, and by no means too large for her
age, seemed such great awkward things. If she
had put one of them in at the window of a dwarf
house, it would have knocked everything out of
its place.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” thought Olive, “I had no idea <i>I</i>
could seem clumsy! I feel like a great plowman.
I wish I were not so big.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said a voice beside her, “it has its disadvantages;”
and Olive, looking down to see
who spoke&mdash;she had to look down for everything&mdash;caught
sight of one of the two dwarfs with
whom she had first spoken. She felt a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ruffled. She did not like this trick of the dwarf
hearing what she thought before she said it.</p>

<p>“Everything has its disadvantages,” she replied.
“Don’t you find yourself very inconveniently
small when you are up in <i>our</i> world?”</p>

<p>“Exactly so,” said the dwarf; but he did not
seem the least put out.</p>

<p>“They are certainly very good-tempered,”
said Olive to herself. Then suddenly a thought
struck her.</p>

<p>“Your village is very neat and pretty,” she
said; “though, perhaps&mdash;I don’t mean to be
rude, not on any account&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted the dwarf; “Auntie told
you on no account to be rude.”</p>

<p>“Auntie!” repeated Olive, in astonishment;
“she is not <i>your</i> auntie!”</p>

<p>“On no account,” said the dwarf, in the same
calm tone, but without seeming to take in that
Olive meant to reprove him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s no use trying to make them understand,”
said Olive to herself.</p>

<p>“Not the least,” said the dwarf; at which
Olive felt so provoked that she could have stamped
her feet with irritation. But as <i>thinking</i> crossly
seemed in this country to be quite as bad as
<i>speaking</i> crossly, she had to try to swallow down
her vexation as well as she could.</p>

<p>“I was going to say,” she went on quietly,
“that to my taste the village would be prettier
if there was a little variety. Not all the houses
just the same, you know. And all of <i>you</i> are so
like each other, and all your little brown wives
too. Are there no <i>children</i> dwarfs?”</p>

<p>“Doubtless. Any quantity,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then where are they all?” said Olive. “Are
they all asleep?” She put the last question
rather sarcastically, but the sarcasm seemed to
be lost on the little man.</p>

<p>“Yes, all asleep,” he replied; “all asleep, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
dreaming. Children are very fond of dreaming,”
he went on, looking up at Olive with such a
queer expression, and such a queer tone in his
voice too, that Olive got a queer feeling herself,
as if he meant more than his words actually said.
Could he mean to hint that <i>she</i> was dreaming?
But a remark from the dwarf distracted her
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Supper is ready,” he said. “They are all
waiting.” And turning round, Olive saw before
her a cottage a good deal larger than the others;
in fact, it was almost high enough for her, with
considerable stooping, to get in at the door. And
through the windows she saw a long table neatly
covered with a bright blue table-cloth, and spread
with numbers of tiny plates, and beside each
plate a knife and fork and a little blue glass cup.
Two great dishes stood on the table, one at each
end. Steam was rising from each, and a delicious
smell came out through the open windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not know I was so hungry,” thought
Olive; “but I do <i>hope</i> it isn’t fir-cones.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the dwarf; “they’ll be better done
this time.”</p>

<p>Then he gave a sort of sharp, sudden cry or
whistle, and immediately all the dwarfs of the
village appeared as if by magic, and began
hurrying into the house, but as soon as they
were in the middle of the passage they fell
back at each side, leaving a clear space in the
middle.</p>

<p>“For you,” said the first dwarf, bowing politely.</p>

<p>“Do you always have supper here altogether
like that?” said Olive. “How funny!”</p>

<p>“Not at all.” said the dwarf; “it’s a table
d’hôte. Be so good as to take your place.”</p>

<p>Olive bent her head cautiously in preparation
for passing through the door, when again the
same sharp cry startled her, and lifting her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
suddenly she bumped it against the lintel. The
pain of the blow was rather severe.</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?” she exclaimed
angrily. “Why did you scream out like that?
I&mdash;&mdash;” But she said no more. The cry was repeated,
and this time it did its work effectually,
for Olive awoke. Awoke&mdash;was it waking?&mdash;to
find herself all in the dark, stiff and cold, and
her head aching with the bump she had given it
against the old tree-trunk, while farther off now
she heard the same shrill hoot or cry of some
early astir night-bird, which had sounded before
in her dreams.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! oh dear!” she sobbed, “what shall
I do? Where am I? How can I ever find my
way in the dark? I believe it was all a trick of
those nasty blue dwarfs. I don’t believe I <i>was</i>
dreaming. They must be spiteful goblins. I
wish I had not gone with them to see their village.”
And so for some minutes, half asleep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
half awake, Olive stayed crouching by the tree,
which seemed her only protector. But by degrees,
as her senses&mdash;her common sense particularly&mdash;came
back to her, she began to realize
that it was worse than useless to sit there crying.
Dark as it was, she must try to find her way
back to the little inn, where, doubtless, Auntie
and the others were in the greatest distress about
her, the thought of which nearly made her burst
out crying again; and poor Olive stumbled up
to her feet as best she could, fortunately not forgetting
to feel for her book and parasol which
were lying beside her and slowly and tremblingly
made her way on a few steps, hoping that
perhaps if she could manage to get out of the
shadow of the trees it might not be quite so dark
farther on. She was not altogether disappointed.
It certainly grew a very little less black, but that
it was a very dark night there was no denying.
And, indeed, though it had not been dark, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
would have had the greatest difficulty in finding
her way out of the wood, into which she had so
thoughtlessly penetrated. Terrifying thoughts,
too, began to crowd into her mind, though, as I
think I have shown you, she was not at all a
timid child. But a forest on a dark night, and
so far away from everywhere&mdash;it was enough to
shake her nerves. She hoped and trusted there
was no fear of wolves in summer-time; but bears!&mdash;ah!
as to bears there was no telling. Even
the hooting cries of the birds which she now and
then again heard in the distance frightened her,
and she felt that a bat flapping against her would
send her nearly out of her mind. And after a
while she began to lose heart&mdash;it was not quite
so dark, but she had not the very least idea where
she was going. She kept bumping and knocking
herself against the trunks; she was evidently
not in a path, but wandering farther and farther
among the forest trees. That was about all she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
could feel sure of, and after two or three more vain
efforts Olive fairly gave up, and, sinking down on
the ground, again burst into tears.</p>

<p>“If I but had a mariner’s compass,” she
thought, her fancy wandering off to all the
stories of lost people she had ever heard of. Then
she further reflected that a compass would do her
very little good if it was too dark to see it, and
still more as she had not the slightest idea
whether her road lay north, south, east, or west.
“If the stars were out!” was her next idea;
but then, I am ashamed to say, Olive’s ideas of
astronomy were limited. She could have perhaps
recognized the Plow and the Pole star, but she
could not remember which way they pointed.
Besides, she did not feel quite sure that in Thüringen
one would see the same stars as in England
or Paris; and, after all, as there were none visible,
it was no good puzzling about it, only if
they <i>had</i> been there it would not have seemed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
lonely. Suddenly&mdash;what was that in the distance?
A light, a tiny light, bobbing in and out
of sight among the trees? Could it be a star
come out of its way to take pity on her? Much
more likely a Will-o’-the-wisp; for she did not
stop to reflect that a dry pine forest in summer-time
is not one of Will-o’-the-wisp’s favorite playgrounds.
It was a light, as to that there was no
doubt, and it was coming nearer. Whether she
was more frightened or glad Olive scarcely knew.
Still, almost anything was better than to sit
there to be eaten up by bears, or to die of starvation;
and she eagerly watched the light now
steadily approaching her, till it came near enough
for her to see that it was a lantern carried by
some person not high above the ground. A boy
perhaps; could it be&mdash;oh, joyful thought!&mdash;could
it be Rex? But no; even if they were all looking
for her it was not likely that they would let
Rex be running about alone to get lost too. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
it must <i>be</i> a boy, and without waiting to think
more Olive called out&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, please come and help me! I’m lost in the
wood!” she cried, thinking nothing of German
or anything but her sore distress.</p>

<p>The lantern moved about undecidedly for a
moment or two, then the light flashed towards
her and came still nearer.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach Gott!</i>” exclaimed an unfamiliar voice,
and Olive, peering forward, thought for half a
second she was again dreaming. He was not,
certainly, dressed in blue, and he was a good
deal taller than up to her knee; but still he was&mdash;there
was no doubt about it&mdash;he was a dwarf!
And another gaze at his queer little figure and
bright sparkling eyes told Olive that it was the
very same little man who had smiled at Rex
and her when he saw them leaning out of the
inn window that very afternoon.</p>

<p>She didn’t feel frightened; he looked so good-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and so sorry for her. And somehow
Olive’s faith in the possible existence of a nation
of dwarfs had received a shock; she was much
more inclined to take things prosaically. But it
was very difficult to explain matters. I think
the dwarf at the first moment was more inclined
to take <i>her</i> for something supernatural than she
was now to imagine him a brownie or a gnome.
For she was a pretty little girl, with a mass of
golden fair hair and English blue eyes; and with
her hat half fallen off, and her cheeks flushed,
she might have sat for a picture of a fairy who
had strayed from her home.</p>

<p>Her German seemed all to go out of her head.
But she managed to remember the name of the
village where they had been that afternoon, and
a sudden recollection seemed to come over the
dwarf. He poured out a flood of words and exclamations,
amidst which all that Olive could
understand was the name of the village and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
words “<i>verirrt</i>,” “<i>armes Kind</i>,” which she knew
meant “lost” and “poor child.” Then he went on
to tell that he too was on his way from the same
village to somewhere; that he came by the woods,
because it was shorter, and lifting high his lantern,
gave Olive to understand that he could now
show her the way.</p>

<p>So off she set under his guidance, and, only
fancy! a walk of not more than ten minutes
brought them to the little inn! Olive’s wanderings
and straying had, after all, drawn her very
near her friends if she had known it. Poor
Auntie and Rex were running about in front of
the house in great distress. Uncle and the landlord
and the coachman had set off with lanterns,
and the landlady was trying to persuade Auntie
that there was not <i>really</i> anything to be afraid
of; neither bears, nor wolves, nor evilly-disposed
people about: the little young lady had, doubtless,
fallen asleep in the wood with the heat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
fatigue of the day; which, as you know, was a
very good guess, though the landlady little imagined
what queer places and people Olive had
been visiting in her sleep.</p>

<p>The dwarf was a well-known person thereabouts,
and a very harmless, kindly little man.
A present of a couple of marks sent him off to
his cottage near by very happy indeed, and when
Uncle returned a few minutes later to see if the
wanderer had been heard of, you can imagine
how thankful he was to find her. It was not so
<i>very</i> late after all, not above half-past ten o’clock,
but a thunderstorm which came on not long after
explained the unusual darkness of the cloud-covered
sky.</p>

<p>“<i>What</i> a good thing you were safe before the
storm came on!” said Auntie, with a shudder at
the thought of the dangers her darling had escaped.
“I will take care never again to carry
my jokes too far,” she resolved, when Olive had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
confided to her the real motive of her wanderings
in the wood. And Olive, for her part, decided
that she would be content with fairies and dwarfs
in books and fancy, without trying to find them
in reality.</p>

<p>“Though all the same,” she said to herself,
“I should have liked to taste the roast fir-cones.
They did smell so good!” “And, Auntie,” she
said aloud, “were you singing in the wood on
your way home with Uncle and Rex?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Auntie, “they begged me to sing
‘Home, sweet Home.’ Why do you ask me?”</p>

<p>Olive explained. “So it was <i>your</i> voice I heard
when I thought it was the dwarfs,” she said,
smiling.</p>

<p>And Auntie gave her still another kiss.</p>

rather inculcated by example than intruded as sermons.</p>

twelve children of a hard-pressed Dr. Partridge out of which is chosen a

<p class="reduct">“It seems to me not at all easier to draw a lifelike child than to draw
a lifelike man or woman: Shakespeare and Webster were the only two
men of their age who could do it with perfect delicacy and success.
Our own age is more fortunate, on this single score at least, having a
larger and far nobler proportion of female writers; among whom, since
the death of George Eliot, there is none left whose touch is so exquisite

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
